            <p>Benito Mussolini recently told the world that he works sixteen hours a day.</p>
            <p>Shallow minded observers will conclude that, if such a, program is feasible for Il
               Duce, it is practicable for the ordinary workingman.</p>
            <p>The deduction would be fallacious even if the premise stands as correct.</p>
            <p>The Premier of Italy has varied and interesting work, which ever stirs anew his creative
               instincts and his boundless energies. His daily chores, full of high adventure and
               the stimulus of leadership, are not to be compared with the monotonous routine of
               the factory worker.</p>
            <p>The great human problem in connection with machine civilization is to minimize the
               monotony and <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e76">[Page]</span> drudgery of toilers who must repeat through the day a single, simple process. In
               an earlier period when hand work prevailed, the worker had the creative thrill of
               making a product from the start to the finish. The worker in the modern factory contributes
               only a single step in the process.</p>
            <p>Non-routine workers are not to be compared with those in the factory.</p>
            <p>I visited Arthur Schnitzler at Vienna last summer, and discussed his methods with
               him. When he tires of a play on which he may be working, that veteran author turns
               to an essay. When his attention begins to lag, he lays that aside, and does some work
               on a novel. Then he may shift to a short story. He usually produces at least four
               works of art at the same time, finding relaxation in turning from one to another.</p>
            <p>The human mind loves variety; it loathes monotony.</p>
            <p>Personnel directors in modern business establishments should recognize the wisdom
               in breaking up tedium either with recesses or rest periods, or preferably by shifting
               workers at intervals from one task to another.</p>
            <p>With immigration restricted, employers are coming to understand the need of economizing
               labor, which receives high wages. The real need is not to get work<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e93">[Page]</span>ers to put in hours, but to keep them interested while they are at work.</p>
            <p>The field, which is still virgin, offers large opportunities for cooperation between
               practical business men and psychologists.</p>
            <p>After work, the wise individual who recognizes the restfulness of variety will find
               fuller ways to use leisure time, which is too frequently frittered away.</p>
            <p>The trite expression, »variety is the spice of life« is in accordance with the findings
               of psychologists and the experience of leaders in commerce and in art.</p>
            <p>Seeing new scenery and new faces on vacations has a tonic effect. It stimulates the
               imagination and tones up an individual.</p>
