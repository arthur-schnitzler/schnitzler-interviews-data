               bowed over the deathbed of a beloved child, served to recall to me the tender relation

As
               I glanced at the words I conjured up the (for me) memorable visit to his home on <a id="T_I061-1"><!--anchor--></a>Sternwartestrasse<span class="note" id="T_I061-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘Sterwartestrasse’</span></span> in the fashionable new <a id="K_I061-77"><!--anchor--></a>cottage section<span class="note" id="K_I061-77h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span></span> of Vienna, and the admonition, kindly and sage, and afterward long pondered, which
               he then gave me.</p>
            <p>I had invited the »finest portraitist of the old Austrian regime,« as Dr. Schnitzler
               has often been called, to furnish an introduction to a charming racy book of <a id="KT147-1"><!--anchor--></a> memoirs <span class="note" id="KT147-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="bibl">Hermynia Zur Mühlen: Ende und Anfang.

               witty and engaging, acerb and thoroughly objective in her revelations of pre-war Austria
               and Russia, into which country she <a id="KT147-2"><!--anchor--></a>married<span class="note" id="KT147-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Victor von Zur Mühlen stammte aus Estland, das bis <span class="date">1918</span> zu Russland gehörte.</span>; and a tone of indulgent irony permeates her easy style. This being so, it was but
               natural to call on Arthur Schnitzler, also gentle and ironical and tout-a-fait Viennois,
               to supply an introduction to the <a id="KT147-8"><!--anchor--></a> American edition<span class="note" id="KT147-8h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="bibl">Hermynia Zur Mühlen: The Runaway Countess. Translated from the German by Frank Barnes.

            <p>Dr. Schnitzler in reply to my request pleaded the urgency of other work, although
               he admitted that he was strongly tempted. He was, of course, familiar with the milieu
               and the characters involved, but his role was that of the creative artist. He declined
               gracefully. To the production of novels and plays he must, he felt, henceforth exclusively
               devote himself, as in the past. Behind his prosaic words I glimpsed the phantasmal
               outline of his grief over a dead daughter.</p>
            <p><a id="I061_L_crushed"><!--anchor--></a>That daughter, it will be remembered, had but recently married an Italian <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> <a id="K_implied_14850"><!--anchor--></a> nobleman <span class="note" id="K_implied_14850h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Arnoldo Cappellini, der zwar (faschistischer) Offizier, aber kein Adeliger war</span>, and a few weeks after her wedding she committed <a id="K_I061-112"><!--anchor--></a>suicide<span class="note" id="K_I061-112h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Dies ist nicht mit letzter Sicherheit feststellbar.

                  bleibt ungeklärt.</span> in Venice. Dr. Schnitzler <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> <a id="K_I061-44"><!--anchor--></a>chartered a special plane<span class="note" id="K_I061-44h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Es stimmt, dass Schnitzler flog, aber mit der Linienmaschine.</span> and flew to her bedside, but it was too late. The girl was dead. Broken in spirit,
               his face older and more tired, his eyes sadder, Schnitzler returned to Vienna and
               withdrew more and more deeply within himself. Of course, he still has his only son,
               a promising young actor, whom he sees nowadays from time to time. I cannot forget
               his sigh when he said: »It is hard to work in peace nowadays, free from crushing anxiety.
               It is not like before the war.« And I sometimes wonder if old age and a consciousness
               of great work well done will at last bring him the healing gift of millennial peace.</p>
            <p>Circumstances had, of course, been relentless toward him, as toward many others, during
               the spare and bitter war years and during the inflation of the Austrian crown and
               the German mark. His work was practically at a standstill. The royalties from the
               output of a lifetime – about twenty volumes of novels and plays in all – amounted
               to exactly  5. This was his income from the Fischer verlag, his German publishers.</p>
            <p>Turkenschanz Park, near Schnitzler’s home, is one of the loveliest spots in Vienna.
               As the name indicates, the Turks, during their prolonged investment of the city, had
               built a fort there.</p>
            <p>A short, stout man with curly brown hair and beard, profusely dusted with gray, came
               to meet me. His forehead was narrow, lined, his nose long and well modeled, his lips
               thick and full. But his most arresting feature was his eyes – they were deep-sunk
               and had penumbra; they where by no means cynical, as one might perhaps expect from
               some of his plays, but weary, self-effacing, asking little of people and things. He
               was well past sixty. </p>
            <p>He greeted me cordially. The room, oblong in shape and not very large, was lined with
               rows of beautifully bound books. Near the window stood a tall desk with a sloping
               top like a shutter, surmounted by a <a id="I061_L_schlafrockii"><!--anchor--></a>porcelain figure of <a id="K_I061-2"><!--anchor--></a>Goethe in Schlafrock<span class="note" id="K_I061-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Es handelt sich um eine Keramik von Michael Powolny, die Goethe in einem roten Mantel

Vgl. auch <a class="link_ref" href="#I061_L_schlafrockii" title=""></a></span>. At this desk, he later told me, he had done most of his writing, standing up. Fully
               thirty-two years had elapsed since »Anatole,« subtitled a <a id="KT147-3"><!--anchor--></a>Comedy of Seduction<span class="note" id="KT147-3h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Irrige Angaben: die 32 Jahre deuten auf <span class="date">1897</span>, dabei erschien Anatol<span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span><span class="date">1892</span>; der Untertitel legt eine Verwechslung mit Komödie der Verführung (<span class="date">1924</span>) nahe.</span>, had been first produced, and more than <a id="KT147-9"><!--anchor--></a>thirty years<span class="note" id="KT147-9h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Am Titelblatt von Reigen ist der Entstehungszeitraum vermerkt: »<span class="quote">‘<span class="date">Winter 1896/97</span>’</span>« (<span class="bibl">Reigen.

               of love.</p>
            <p>Since that time his orany has grown gentler and more mature, but he never gave up
               his role, which he filled in those two youthful <a id="K_implied_29935"><!--anchor--></a> works <span class="note" id="K_implied_29935h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Anatol, Reigen</span>, of a subtle diagnostician of men and women, never shallow, never witty for wit’s
               sake alone. Except in »The Green Cockatoo,« Schnitzler has never proved himself a
               scintillating dramatist steeped in the waters of the eighteenth century. He had written
               »Professor Bernhardi,« »<a id="KT147-10"><!--anchor--></a> Light of Love <span class="note" id="KT147-10h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Liebelei</span>,« »<a id="K_I061-4"><!--anchor--></a>The Country of the Soul<span class="note" id="K_I061-4h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Das weite Land, wobei keine Übersetzung unter diesem Titel erschienen ist</span>,« »Bertha Garlan,« »Lieutenant Gustl,«, »The Road to the Open,« »Casanova’s Homecoming«
               – innumerable plays, novels and short stories, a small handful of which I had the

               love of man’s weakness and man’s inevitable illusions of pride, love and ambition.</p>
            <p>He sketched his beginnings as a writer for me: how, far back in the eighties and nineties,
               he and the late Hugo von Hofmannsthal were closely associated, Von Hofmannsthal writing
               exquisite Parnassian poetry and Schnitzler emerging as a realistic satirist, witty
               and graceful, softening the naturalist current which had reached Vienna via Berlin
               and Paris.</p>
            <p>»I owe my recognition,« he said, »to a young <a id="KT147-5"><!--anchor--></a> journalist <span class="note" id="KT147-5h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Paul Goldmann, der aber erst nachdem er Schnitzlers Anfänge als Redakteur von An der
                  schönen blauen Donau unterstützt hatte, zum Mitarbeiter der Neuen Freien Presse wurde.</span> on the <span class="italics">Neue Freie Presse</span>. He at once perceived the importance of the new movement and my relation to it. He
               pointed out that I gazed into the human soul and made people speak as though they
               were under the influence of Professor Charcot, the French psychologist, who at that
               time used hypnotism in his cures. Professor Charcot’s experiments affected me deeply
               and set me thinking, as they also did Professor Freud, who was, I believe, his assistant
               in Paris then. The direct outcome of this influence may be seen in ›Anatole,‹ where
               hypnotism is employed as a dramatic device. Both as an artist and a physician, however,
               I felt that hypnotism was inadequate in the long run. But it did help me in some way
               to get an insight into the inner life of my characters. ›Reigen‹ was written as a
               series of case histories. Does this surprise you? The question I asked myself was
               this: Clinically speaking, how do certain people, drawn from all classes, act under
               the stress of sexual passion? I have been accused of having produced a kind of sublimated
               joke. Ah, not at all. The ›Hands Around‹ idea was best fitted to carry out my purpose.«</p>
            <p>»As a poet he is unequaled, but I find his plays a little lacking in humanity. Von
               Hofmannsthal is the modern counterpart of Ben Jonson – if you will make huge allowances
               for the differences of temperament and age. You must remember that his prose comedies
               have no kinship with his verse. But he is scholarly, even wonderfully erudite, and
               he is quick to see the humors in people. This is what concerns him most and in this
               trait he comes closest to the Elizabethan. He is a good example of the playwright
               of humors; but realistic comedy, when all is said and done, is not his special field.
               He is essentially a poet, a great dramatic poet, as his librettos written for Strauss’s
               music show, and one of the finest Austria has ever produced.«</p>
            <p>Since these words were spoken, the two lifelong friends, as everybody knows, have
               suffered kindred tragedies, tragedies of fate with nothing less than a Sophoclean
               touch, in their own lives. Schnitzler’s daughter and Von Hofmannsthal’s young <a id="KT147-7"><!--anchor--></a> son <span class="note" id="KT147-7h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Franz von Hofmannsthal starb am <span class="date">13. 7. 1929</span> im Alter von 25 Jahren.</span> committed suicide within a <a id="K_I061-12"><!--anchor--></a>short period<span class="note" id="K_I061-12h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>ziemlich genau ein Jahr lag zwischen den beiden Tragödien</span> of each other. In Von Hofmannsthal’s case the shock of the catastrophe was the immediate
               cause of the <a id="KT147-12"><!--anchor--></a>poet’s death<span class="note" id="KT147-12h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Hugo von Hofmannsthal starb zwei Tage nach dem Suizid des Sohnes, am <span class="date">15. 7. 1929</span>, an einem Schlaganfall.</span>.</p>
            <p>After talking to Schnitzler for a half hour or so, I said to him:</p>
            <p>»This is not an interview, Herr <a id="TT147-1"><!--anchor--></a>Doktor<span class="note" id="TT147-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘Docktor’</span></span>. I shall not use it unless –«</p>
            <p>»You may use whatever I say,« he replied, smiling. »But if you are wise you will wait
               several years. Interviewers have come to me from all over the world – and misrepresented
               me most horribly. I should like somebody who really knows me to write an interview.
               Now take this, for example« – and he strode over to his desk and drew out a newspaper
               clipping – »here is an <a id="KT147-63"><!--anchor--></a>interview<span class="note" id="KT147-63h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>nicht ermittelt</span> from a New York newspaper. It states, to begin with, that I am a man-about-town,
               that I attend all the redouts, that I am invariably to be seen at first nights and
               all important social functions; that I am to be seen at Sacher’s every single night,
               drinking champagne or smoking an after-dinner cigar. This, as you know, is simply
               tissue of colorful lies. Of course I may now and then attend a first night – but then
               I am a dramatist. For me the main difference between the pre-war period and the present
               is this: Previously I had leisure and peace in which to work. Now, due to the state
               of social and political unrest, I am a good deal distracted, as any writer living
               in Vienna must be.«</p>
            <p>As I rose to leave I turned to my host and asked: »Why is it, do you think, that your
               books have not had a steady sale in America?«</p>
            <p>»I believe I am appreciated in America,« he replied, »but so far I do not think I
               have had a fair chance. But the situation is about to change. The American public
               is waking up to the value of a psychological method in the delineation of character.
               Of course, it is easier for any audience to swallow light raillery or gay cynicism
               rather than ripe irony. Irony implies, as you know, a certain amount of intellectual
               sophistication. Perhaps this explains why my Vienna and Budapest colleagues are more
               successful on the New York stage than I am.  While wandering about Vienna,« he called
               after me as I was going out, »don’t forget to read Stifter and Grillparzer.«</p>
            <p>Shortly afterward I called on a well-known Viennese <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> <a id="K_I061-1"><!--anchor--></a> lady <span class="note" id="K_I061-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>nicht identifiziert</span> who had figured brilliantly in pre-war society. I inquired about the authenticity
               of Dr. Schnitzler’s characters.</p>
            <p>»In Schnitzler,« I said, »there is always delicate charm, light amour and so on. Did
               the sex game, as his plays imply, once take up a good part of the lives of the Viennese?«</p>
            <p>The lady laughed, her eyes suddenly grown youthful and gay. »Oh, Schnitzler is very,
               very clever,« she said, extending toward me a platter heaped up with rich pastry.
               »He’s profound, and, of course, almost any woman will recognize herself in one, at
               least, of his characters. I hear he’s been translated into every language. And he
               deserves to be, for he is universal – a great writer.« She paused. Her eyes glistened.
               »But,« she went on »you mustn’t take him too literally. Most of us women, you know,
               dream all our lives of those gay infidelities which he so delicately portrays. But,
               alas! they never come to us. Ah, well!« she sighed.</p>
