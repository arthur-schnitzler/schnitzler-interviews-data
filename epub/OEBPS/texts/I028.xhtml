                  »<span class="quote">‘<span class="capitals">Arthur Schnitzler</span>, perhaps best known to English readers through his ›Anatol‹ cycle, ›The Road to the
                     Open,‹ ›Casanova’s Homecoming‹ and <span class="supplied">[›]</span> Dr. Graesler,‹ stands in the forefront, not only of Jewish creative artists, but
                     of the creative artists of the world as well. His faith, therefore, in the coming
                     of a great Jewish artistic renaissance is a faith which must give pride and hope to
                     every member of the Jewish community. Arthur Schnitzler here sets forth his views
                     on Zionism, anti-Semitism and kindred subjects.’</span>« und ein Porträt mit der Bildunterschrift: »<span class="quote">‘Arthur Schnitzler / Playwright, Poet, Philosopher / Physician and Psychologist’</span>«</span> strikes one as a man who needs all the force of his personality to keep his overwhelming
               brains quiet. That is the dominant impression I had <sup class="sup">of Arthur Schnitzler</sup> after twenty minutes of the most inspiring talk I have enjoyed with any man for <span style="text-decoration: line-through">many</span> months.</p>
            
            <p>In a way this impression comes as a surprise. For there are in Schnitzler’s writing
               certain qualities of suavity which like the outward reserve of a well mannered person,
               are only the outcome of good artistic breeding, but which to superficial people belie
               the real temperament both of the artist and the man. Even a sympathetic and imaginative
               study of Schnitzler’s works will not always correct the error, and that is why I,
               as doubtless many others have done before me, came to him, expecting to find a personality
               cold, polished and courteous, a man of urbane scepticism, and gentle disillusionments,
               a temperamental agnostic, chastened of both anger and enthusiasm.</p>
            
            <p>Of course all these things are precisely, what Schnitzler is not. The first thing
               that strikes one about him is <span style="text-decoration: line-through">the</span><span class="add">⟨a⟩</span> most lov<span style="text-decoration: line-through"><span class="gap"> [...]</span></span><span class="add">⟨able⟩</span> warmth and impetuousnes<span class="add">⟨s⟩</span>. He is both mentally and physically a young man, despite his years. His eye is clear,
               his complexion rosy, and his grey hair and beard are shot with streaks of blond. In
               his mental attitude Schnitzler is equally youthful. Whatever subject he touches, he
               is immediately on fire. His whole heart is in his talk, and he spends himself in it
               as recklessly as a boy of eighteen.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e205">[Page]</span></p>
            
            <p>I found Schnitzler in his little house in the suburbs of Vienna, in itself no mean
               achievement (finding him, I <a id="T_I028-1"><!--anchor--></a>mean)<span class="note" id="T_I028-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘mean’</span></span> <span class="unclear">,[?]</span> for Schnitzler is one of the most sought after people in Europe and has more or less
               to barricade himself against intruders. Schnitzler had broken off some dictation to
               come down to me, and had so to speak to rub his eyes a little before he could launch
               out on the new topic. Also he seemed at first disinclined to grant the interview.</p>
            
            <p>»I never give interviews,« he said. »All I have to say on the Jewish question is in
               my book ›Der Weg in’s Freie‹ I recommend – – –«</p>
            
            <p>»Herr Doctor,« I said, »I have not read Der Weg in’s Freie once but three times and
               it is to discuss that book I have come to you.« An extraordinarily sweet smile broke
               out over Schnitzler’s face.</p>
            
            <p>»You are very flattering,« he said, and motioned me to a seat. And quite suddenly
               we were talking together<span style="text-decoration: line-through">at 90 miles an hour</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Talking to Schnitzler is a delightful business. The same sense of grace and form that
               is so perceptible in his books, is evident in his talk and bearing, despite his vehemence
               and ready enthusiasm. He has among other things a perfect genius for letting himself
               be interrupted. If he sees you have something to say he waves you off so to speak
               for a couple of sentences, and then gives you a fraction of a second to leap into
               the talk. It is like an obliging bus driver slowing down between the official stopping
               places.<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e252">[Page]</span></p>
            
            <p>As one speaks to him, <span style="text-decoration: line-through">one</span><sup class="sup">and</sup> becomes conscious of this terrific depth and intensity of feeling of the continous
               mental rush going on with<span class="add">⟨in⟩</span> the man<span class="add">⟨,⟩</span> one forms some conception of the degree of unrelenting discipline it must cost Schnitzler
               to have what he is namely one of the most polished and urbane writers in contemporary
               Europe. How easily that quick sensitivity, that overready response of the heart might
               have swamped his judgment and dimmed his taste! If Schnitzler had not been Schnitzler,
               he would one feels (not without a silent thanksgiving to Heaven for a calamity so
               nearly averted<span class="add">⟨)⟩</span>, have made one of those prolific emotional writers, who despite the presence of real
               talent never rise higher than the second rank in in the artistic hierarchy. <a id="KT114-2"><!--anchor--></a>I remember thinking at the time that God hat originally intended Schnitzler for a
               sort of Upton Sinclair, and then at the last minute changed his mind.<span class="note" id="KT114-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Dieser Satz durch eine Linie vom Anfang des übernächsten Absatzes hierher bewegt.</span></p>
            
            <p>The truth is that there are two Schnitzlers. There is the emotional Schnitzler with
               the irresistible creative urge in him, and there is his mentor warder and familiar
               spirit, the critical Schnitzler, and it is by a collaboration of the two separate
               individuals that Schnitzler’s works come into being. This critical Schnitzler, I don’t
               mind telling you, is the devil of a fellow. He is persistent wakeful and utterly unrelenting.
               Even in his own domain, having no other object for his <span class="add">⟨fury⟩</span>, he turns and lacerates himself.</p>
            
            <p>»When I attempt any sort of critical or reflective writing,« said Schnitzler, »I am
               half strangled by my own parentheses.«</p>
            
            <p>In other words Schnitzler is one of those not altogether enviable<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e324">[Page]</span>   <a id="T_I028-2"><!--anchor--></a>individuals whose<span class="note" id="T_I028-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘whose’</span></span> judgments and critical faculty never have a holiday. It is a heavy price to pay,
               but in Schnitzler’s case the game is <a id="T_I028-12"><!--anchor--></a>worth the candle<span class="note" id="T_I028-12h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘worth candle’</span></span>.</p>
            
            <p>That Schnitzler should have had plenty to say on the Jewish question, was only to
               be expected. He has written about it enough. »Professor Bernhardi« touches it. The
               immortal ineffable »<a id="K_I028-43"><!--anchor--></a><a id="T_I028-11"><!--anchor--></a>Lieutenant<span class="note" id="T_I028-11h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘Lietnant’</span></span> Gustl« is full of it<span class="note" id="K_I028-43h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Zwar äußert die Titelfigur einiges Antisemitisches, doch scheint die Behauptung, es
                  ginge darin um die »jüdische Frage« vor allem die Unkenntnis des Interviewers bloßzulegen.</span>. But above all »Der Weg in’s Freie« is remarkable for its brilliant, I might almost
               say its brutal treatment of this subject. In Heinrich <a id="T_I028-123"><!--anchor--></a>Beermann<span class="note" id="T_I028-123h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="supplied">[hier und in Folge:]</span> <span class="quote">‘Behrmann’</span></span>, the Jewish litterateur Schnitzler has drawn with such masterly dispassionate accuracy
               a certain type of central European Jew that I have always maintained no study of the
               Jewish question could be considered complete without a perusal of this work. Beermann
               is by no means a perfect being. He is oversensitive, self analytical, and, I am very
               much afraid inclined to be tactless yet <span class="add">⟨he is⟩</span> a man of real ability and many virtues. Circumstances have, I think made Beermann
               what he is, and though I could not get him to make a definite pronouncement on the
               subject, I am inclined <sup class="sup">to believe</sup> that Schnitzler thinks so too. For I discussed Beermann with Schnitzler just as I
               would discuss a living person. There was nothing incongruous about this, because Beermann
               happens to be alive. You will meet his like all over Vienna, or for that matter with
               a slightly different accent, all over Germany.</p>
            
            <p><span style="text-decoration: line-through">I </span> <a id="TT114-3"><!--anchor--></a> <span style="text-decoration: line-through">had</span> <span class="note" id="TT114-3h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘chd’</span></span>   <span style="text-decoration: line-through">a long talk with him one night after the opera at one of those excellent Viennise

Incidentally he is the dramatic critic of the – but perhaps that is becoming personal.</span> <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e441">[Page]</span></p>
            
            <p> <span class="add">⟨»⟩</span>The solution of the Jewish Problem,« <sup class="sup">said Schnitzler</sup> »is one which each individual must find for himself. <a id="L-I028-1"><!--anchor--></a>There is no general solution. Zionism does not seem to me to be a solution at all.
               It seems to me too much actuated by sudden impulses, by resentment, by a mere desire
               to escape from one’s environment and scarcely ever to spring from a well-reasoned
               decision. This does not prevent me from admiring Zionism. I admire people who can
               reach out so high and dream so splendidly, but they will never convince me.</p>
            
            <p>I need hardly point out that the Zionist plays actively into the hands of the anti-Semite.
               He confesses to a weakness in our position which my mind does not exist. My parents
               come from Hungary, but my <a id="K_I028-44"><!--anchor--></a>desire takes me back neither to Hungary<span class="note" id="K_I028-44h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span></span> nor Palestine. I am rooted here in Vienna, my home and the home of my youth. I have
               grown up identifying myself with the highly individual culture. I am part of it, and
               it is part of me. Why should I leave this country because a few ignorant and illbred
               fools of anti-Semites tell me I do not belong here?</p>
            
            <p> <span class="add">⟨»⟩</span>Do I believe that there is a basic individual Jewish character apart from certain
               traits which environment has forced upon it<span style="text-decoration: line-through">.</span><span class="add">⟨?⟩</span> That is a difficult question<span class="unclear">;[?]</span> yet I should if anything be inclined to a negative <a id="T_I028-1234"><!--anchor--></a>answer.<span class="note" id="T_I028-1234h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘answer’</span></span> I do not believe that the Jew is essentially spiritually different or that there
               is a difference of spiritual rhythm between him <a id="T_I028-113"><!--anchor--></a>and<span class="note" id="T_I028-113h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘a’</span></span> the gentile. The attitude of the world towards him has produced certain psychological
               modifications. Take away this attitude, and those modifications will <span style="text-decoration: line-through">vanish. I believe every <span class="gap"> [...]</span> of jewish parentage even of</span><sup class="sup">vanish. I believe that if a child of jewish parentage, even of</sup> the humblest sort, were to be taken to another country, kept in ignorance of its
               origin if that origin were also kept from its associates, that this child would grow
               up absolutely unconscious of a difference between itself and its playmates, except
               perhaps that it might develop and become<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e511">[Page]</span> aware of a keener and quicker brain.</p>
            
            <p><a id="TT114-4"><!--anchor--></a>I am however compelled to admit that there is a sort of Freemasonary between Jews.
               We unconsciously feel our way to one another more quickly than we do to gentiles.
               There is a readier unspoken understanding. But how far this implies an actual being
               different on our part I hesitate to say.<span class="note" id="TT114-4h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Absatz fehlt im Erstdruck</span></p>
            
            <p>Why anti-Semitism has gained so much strength recently? I think it has to do with
               the general state the world is in at present. Remember that a wave of hate has swept
               over the peoples of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">world</span><sup class="sup">earth</sup>, and that hate is a very real deep rooted instinct, which must have its vent once
               it is aroused. Some object must be found for it, and it is therefore not unnaturally,
               that it concentrates on a section of the community that enjoys a certain traditional
               privilege of persecution, a section of the community<span class="add">⟨,⟩</span> moreover<span class="add">⟨,⟩</span> which for some reason or other is weakened by an excessive objectivity and by a certain
               inclination to self analysis, and is therefore perhaps a readier victim.</p>
            
            <p>Do I think that the Jews are a creative people? I must unhesitatingly answer that
               I do. Look at the names that we can show within a short space of time. <a id="TT114-5"><!--anchor--></a>In music Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler. In painting Max Liebermann, in literature
               a whole host of names.<span class="note" id="TT114-5h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Das fehlt im Erstdruck, weil Strauss kein Jude war. Oberhalb von Strauss ein unentziffertes

               these things must become aware of it.</p>

                  <p>The interview you so kindly granted me appeared in America some time ago, and a copy
                     of it has been for weeks following me over Europe. As the delay has already been considerable,
                     I do sincerely hope you will not be angry with me for sending this copy, the only
                     copy I have at present to D<sup>r</sup>   Benedict, who told me that he might perhaps want to use it, but whom I have requested
                     to pass the copy on to you when he has done with it. <span style="text-decoration:underline">I have, however, written to </span><span style="text-decoration:underline">America</span> for further copies and hope to be able to send one on to you in about a fortnight.</p>

                  <p>I am glad to say that my stupid mistake in making you refer to <span style="text-decoration:underline">Strauss</span> as a Jew did not appear in print, otherwise the interview was printed as in the copy
                     submitted to you, except for a few trifling excisions.</p>
