            <p>Now, that Arthur Schnitzler, the famous German novelist and playwright, is growing
               old his deepest regret is that he has never visited America. It is true that men far
               older than he have successfully made the trip across the ocean. Only recently, Sir
               George Henschel, the English composer and conductor came here to help the Boston Symphony
               Orchestra, celebrate its fiftieth anniversary – and Sir George has already seen his
               eightieth year. A man, however, is as old as he feels – and, though Arthur Schnitzler
               is only sixty-eight, he feels much, much, older. His face is deeply wrinkled. His
               eyes are dull and appear sad and tired over heavy bags, he walks with a heavy gait
               and with stooped back. In spirit and in flesh he is already an old man.</p>
            
            <p>But though he is old and feels that death cannot be very far away, there is by no
               means any melancholy or despair in him.</p>
            
            <p><a id="I011_L2_todie"><!--anchor--></a>»Younger men than I have been known to die,« he said softly and peacefully – one could
               easily see that the contemplation of death did not frighten him in the least. »I have
               worked hard during my life, and when the time comes I am quite prepared to go. Of
               course, as long as life is spared me so long will there be more and more work for
               me to complete. My pen is never idle. I am now working on three books, and should
               it be fated that I complete them all I shall gladly begin work on others. However,
               I am always ready to drop my pen, because I feel and know that I have lived both wisely
               and well during my lifetime. At least my conscience in that direction is clear.«</p>
            
            <p>And a moment, later he added, as though in afterthought: »But I do have one deep regret.
               My greatest sorrow at present is that I have never visited your remarkable country,
               and therefore have never had the enviable opportunity of seeing it and studying it
               at first hand. And, unfortunately, I am now too old to remedy this!«</p>
            
            <p><a id="I011_L1_bookcase"><!--anchor--></a>We were sitting on the comfortably soft couch in Arthur Schnitzler’s charming study.
               The walls are <a id="T_I011-1"><!--anchor--></a>covered<span class="note" id="T_I011-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘cov’</span></span> with bookcases heavily lined with books. One of these bookcases, modestly covered
               by a velvet curtain, contains all of Arthur Schnitzler’s works in all translated languages.
               The one window of the room looks out upon a luxuriously fertile <a id="K_I011-1"><!--anchor--></a>garden, where during the spring, summer and early autumn Dr. Schnitzler does all of
               his writing<span class="note" id="K_I011-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>das dürfte er nicht gesagt haben; die Aussage, dass er nicht im Freien arbeite, ist
                  wahrscheinlich richtig: </span>. It was rapidly becoming dusk, and the room – as we were talking – was becoming suffused
               with a serene, mellow darkness. Schnitzler did not trouble putting on the light. He
               was buried in the softness of the couch and he was quietly speaking to me about America.</p>
            
            <p>»I have no illusions about America being something of a Utopia in the miniature,«
               he said, »for I well know that it is nothing of the sort. But America interests me
               profoundly – and has interested me for many years already – because it obviously points
               the way to the future. Whether we are at harmony with this future or not; whether,
               even, this future is a desirable one, is beside the point – nor is it a question I
               would care particularly to discuss now. The fact remains that this future is almost
               inevitable, and whether we like it or not we must accept it. Tomorrow Europe will
               be what America is today – and if we are interested in ourselves we must inevitably
               be interested in America too. You have led the way in industry, politics and finance.
               I frankly feel that it will not be very long before you will likewise lead the way
               in matters artistic too.</p>
            
            <p>»From what I have heard and from what I have read I have gathered the fact that America
               is creating a new, unique form of art and culture – a type uniquely its own and one
               which strongly points toward being the art and culture of the future. That is why
               I was so eager to visit America, to try to feel its atmosphere and spirit and to try,
               perhaps, to understand it. Unfortunately, I procrastinated too long.«</p>
            
            <p>Dr. Schnitzler was speaking about our unique art. Was he, perhaps, acquainted with
               our literature?</p>
            
            <p>»Quite naturally, many of your writers have time and again come to my notice – and
               from time to time I have come across much that impressed me very, very deeply. Names
               at the moment elude me. But I can say, at the very least, that you have two outstanding
               great novelists, and certainly at least one profound dramatist. Both Theodore Dreiser
               and Sinclair Lewis (Note: At the time of the conversation it was not yet known that
               Sinclair Lewis was the Nobel prize winner) have contributed something new and original
               to the novel. We Europeans find a vigor and vitality in both Dreiser and Lewis which
               is simply lacking over here. Such prose – palpitant and alive – could have come only
               from an American. And such messages, as their novels express, are intrinsically American.
               As for Eugene O’Neill, he is to me one of the greatest figures in contemporary drama.
               I personally, found his ›Strange Interlude‹ to be prolix and outmoded; this business
               of the ›aside‹ is neither original nor of artistic importance, it seems to me. It
               is such a naive trick to tell what is in a character’s mind which a little bit of
               subtlety would have accomplished with far more aptness. But in his earlier plays –
               in ›All God's Chillun Got Wings‹, and in his ›Emperor Jones‹ – he is a truly great
               figure. These plays grew out of American soil. Their supreme strength lies not only
               in the fact that, taken from artistic standards, they are great plays, but also in
               the fact that these plays could not possibly have come from a European pen. In the
               drama, as well as in the novel, America is now fully emancipated.</p>
            
            <p>»But what impresses me most about America is its remarkably experimental nature, it
               is constantly alert to new ideas and thoughts, far more alert than Europe can hope
               to be. Take such inventions as the motion picture – and now the talking picture and
               the radio and, you will find that in America these have become in a bewilderingly
               short time, an integral part of American life. Such open-mindedness to new things
               has, undoubtedly, given America the reputation of constantly pursuing new fads. But
               this, far from being a regrettable state of affairs, is to me most commendable. It
               is a healthy condition in which it is comparatively easy to make gigantic strides
               forward in the future in scientific and artistic matters. It is the proper soil in
               which fruit can blossom with most fertility.</p>
            
            <p>»You say in America that the drama is dying? To me, of course, such a fear is ridiculous.
               An art can never die. True, drama, because of certain inevitable conditions, is in
               a sort of stagnancy: fluctuating periods of stagnation and fertility are inevitable
               in the life of every art. But to say it is dead, especially when you Americans have
               a man like Eugene O’Neill in your midst, is futile pessimism.</p>
            
            <p>»Talking pictures can never replace the spoken drama. I do not deny the importance
               of the talking picture as a new type of artistic expression – but it is a type of
               artistic expression different from the spoken drama. Talking pictures may supplement
               the drama, but they will never supplant it. At its best it will be eighth lively art
               – and an art in which. I am confident. America will prove to be supreme.«</p>
