            <p><span class="italics"><span class="capitals"><span class="spaced_out">Arthur </span></span> <span class="capitals"><span class="spaced_out">Schnitzler</span></span>, great novelist and playwright of Austria, whose books are known and loved by cultured
                  people all over the world, died of a stroke at his home on <span class="date">October 21</span>. One of the last interviews for publication he granted before his death, if not the
                  very last was granted to David Ewen, Jewish journalist from New York, who visited
                  him in Vienna last summer. The fruits of that interview are presented herewith.</span></p>
            <p><span class="italics">On the opposite page is a critical appreciation of the work of Schnitzler by Isaac
                  Goldberg, well-known critic and author of »The Man Mencken,« »Havelock Ellis,« »The
                  Theatre of George Jean Nathan,« and many other books of literary and artistic interest.</span></p>
            <p><span class="italics">Arthur Schnitzler was buried in Vienna after a short and simple Jewish service, in
                  accordance with his instructions for a pauper’s funeral. The money thus saved was,
                  according to his direction, distributed among hospitals.</span></p>
            <p>In the modern literary world, few names stand out so significantly as that of Arthur
               Schnitzler. A novelist who brought wisdom, a tremendous breadth and scope, a <span class="spaced_out">psychological</span> penetration within his pages; a short-story writer of exquisite subtlety and delicacy;
               a playwright who infused breaths of life into the nostrils of each of his characters
               – Arthur Schnitzler was an artist to the tips of his fingers, an artist who was easily
               one of the outstanding men of genius of our time. Of course, no one can hope to prophesy
               which of our contemporary literary works will struggle their way into immortality;
               such prophecy has more than once proved to be dishearteningly inaccurate. Yet, if
               any of our modern literary achievements are destined to attain permanency, there is
               little doubt among any of our critics that at least a few of Schnitzler’s <a id="T_I091-1"><!--anchor--></a>unforgettable<span class="note" id="T_I091-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘unforgetable’</span></span> tales will be numbered among them. Perhaps it will be the wistful and tender sadness
               of <span class="italics">The Lonely Way</span> one of the great plays of our age; perhaps it will be his remarkable psychological
               studies of men and women – <span class="italics">Bertha Garlan</span>, <span class="italics">Fraulein Else</span>, <span class="italics">Therese</span> – characters which are so vividly etched that they seem to be among us; perhaps,
               it will be his short stories – exquisite moods, each one of them. But certainly works
               such as these cannot pass into oblivion! They have the permanency of all great things
               – that permanency which defies time and customs, a permanency which makes these works
               as immortal as the art they have so enriched.</p>
            <p>Jews may well be proud of Arthur Schnitzler – and proud, not only because he was a
               man of genius (for that, certainly, is no novelty!) but also because he was one of
               those very rare souls who did not sell their birthright for a bowl of pottage. Born
               a Jew, Schnitzler – unlike so many other geniuses – lived as a Jew throughout his
               entire life. Very few indeed, are the great Jewish artists who have not immersed themselves
               so deeply in their art as to forget their race and heritage. Arthur Schnitzler not
               only did not forget his race, he was not only a Jew in heart and in soul throughout
               his career, but he also enlisted, time and again, his gifted pen for Jewish causes.
               When he felt the stings of anti-Semitism levelled against the Jew, he wrote <span class="italics">Prof. Bernhardi</span> – a supremely vitriolic play about anti-Semitism among physicians. In the <span class="italics">Open Road</span>, he discussed the many problems facing the Jew with that clarity, wisdom, and penetration
               which we had long before begun to associate with his writings. And the <a id="K_I091-6"><!--anchor--></a>number of articles on Jewish questions<span class="note" id="K_I091-6h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>solche Artikel hat er nicht geschrieben und publiziert</span> which he produced is incalculable. Never was he too busy with his other literary
               achievements to forget or slight his race when it needed his help.</p>
            <p>Arthur Schnitzler – who died in his sixty-ninth year – was the son of Johann Schnitzler,
               a world-famous laryngologist. It seemed, therefore, that Arthur was destined from
               his birth to be a physician – to carry the name of Schnitzler to still <a id="K_I091-11"><!--anchor--></a>greater heights<span class="note" id="K_I091-11h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Entgegen den hier angeschlagenen Tönen von Schnitzler als medizinischer Nachwuchshoffnung,
                  war er ein eher desinteressierter und durchschnittlicher Student.</span> in the medical field. As a youth Arthur showed himself to be so adept in scientific
               studies that it seemed apparent that such a son would easily bring honor to the name
               he bore. He went through his medical studies with ease and rapidity. The professors
               at the university were extolling his name. He was destined, they prophesied, for a
               great medical career.</p>
            <p>It was at the university that Arthur Schnitzler first was <a id="K_I091-4"><!--anchor--></a>vividly brought to realize that he was a Jew – and what such a responsibility meant.
               But permit Arthur Schnitzler to speak to you himself, just as he spoke to me when
               I visited him. »When I was a student at the university, here in Vienna, a few of the
               more charitable students banded themselves together into a sort of philanthropic society.
               Our mission was to give charity to needy students. Of course, we could not afford
               to give very much, but we knew that even a meager few shillings were better than nothing
               and might spell the difference, to many a student, between living and starvation.
               It was not very long before discrimination set in. When a student pleaded for financial
               help and if his name was unmistakably Jewish – he was immediately, and subtly, removed
               from all consideration. Quite naturally, such discrimination struck me forcibly, and
               I fought bitterly against this unfair treatment which Jewish students received. But
               it was a hopeless fight, as I soon enough realized, and before long I was forced to
               resign from the society. That incident made a profound impression upon me. It was
               my first realization that the Jew was confronted with problems uniquely his own –
               and that the problems of the Jew were likewise my own problems<span class="note" id="K_I091-4h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Bei dieser Passage handelt es sich um eine Variation von .</span>.«</p>
            <p><a id="K_I091-45"><!--anchor--></a>When Schnitzler graduated from the university – and he graduated with the highest
               of honors! – he entered his father’s clinic in order to receive his final medical
               education under the mature guidance of his father. He profited much from his father’s
               instructions, and before long he was prepared to set out himself on a medical career.
               For a few years he travelled through Germany, England, and France to study medical
               conditions in those countries, and also to lecture frequently<span class="note" id="K_I091-45h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Diese Angaben sind falsch (Vorlesungen) oder maßlos übertrieben.</span>. It was not long before he came into his own, before he attained a fame and prestige
               which dangerously rivalled that of his father. Everywhere he was soon recognized as
               the foremost specialist of laryngology of his time – having succeeded, even, in writing
               a very learned paper on the <span class="italics">Nervous Diseases of the Voice</span> – and as the fitting successor to his great father. Everyone was now comfortably
               assured that the young doctor was headed straight towards greatness. The future, it
               seemed now certain, belonged to him.</p>
            <p>But his contemporaries had reckoned without him. In his <a id="K_I091-16"><!--anchor--></a>fortieth year<span class="note" id="K_I091-16h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Schnitzler war knapp 31, als sein Vater starb und er in Folge die berufliche Tätigkeit
                  als Arzt einstellen konnte, wenngleich er einzelne Patientinnen und Patienten noch
                  jahrelang betreute.</span>, Schnitzler (with triumph ringing in his ears, and fame and success at his right
               hand) suddenly did the mad thing. He announced that he was forever through with medicine
               and that he would definitely give himself up to literature. Who can hope to explain
               how such things happen? Something had been long hidden in Schnitzler’s heart, and
               at last it was crying for life, for expression, for the sunlight. And Schnitzler heeded
               the call meekly and bravely. And so, in the face of his bewildered friends and relatives
               – some of whom thought he had gone mad, and others of whom were confident that this
               was only an ephemeral whim – Schnitzler hid himself from society for a full year.
               And he wrote his first play, <span class="italics">Das Maerchen</span>. And then the great physician exchanged his laurels and became now the great literary
               figure. Who will doubt that he had exchanged wisely?</p>
            <p>»Many of my friends,« Dr. Schnitzler told me, in speaking about this incident, »still
               feel that I am a finer doctor than a literary man, and really have greater confidence
               in my treatments than in my novels and plays.« Perhaps. Yet when we read those pathetic,
               beautiful tales about women, which he has fashioned for us with such a tender hand,
               we may regret the passing of the great physician but we hail the arrival of a still
               greater literary figure. Medicine has other celebrated laryngologists, but literature
               has only one Arthur Schnitzler.</p>
            <p><a id="K_I091-8"><!--anchor--></a>As Arthur Schnitzler and I were ramblingly discussing matters of literary and religious
               interest, I had the enviable opportunity of studying the great man at close range.
               We were sitting on the comfortably soft couch in his charming study. The walls were
               covered with books. One of these bookcases, modestly covered by a velvet curtain,
               contained Arthur Schnitzler’s works in all translated languages. The one window of
               the room looked out upon a luxuriously fertile garden where, during the spring, summer,
               and early autumn Dr. Schnitzler did all of his writing. It was rapidly becoming dusk,
               and the room – as we were talking – was becoming suffused with a serene, mellow darkness.
               Schnitzler did not trouble putting on the light. He was buried in the softness of
               his couch – talking.<span class="note" id="K_I091-8h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Bei dieser Passage handelt es sich um eine Variation von .</span></p>
            <p>From so close a range I could clearly see that in spirit and in flesh Arthur Schnitzler
               was an old man. True, many another man at his age still feels energetic and full of
               life. Just recently, Sir Georg Henschel – who is already eighty years old – came to
               America from England to guest-conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra. But a man is
               as old as he feels, and Arthur Schnitzler then felt aged, indeed! The deep wrinkles
               of his face, the grayness of his beard and hair, the heavy bags under his eyes, his
               stooped back, his heavy gait, and his tired look all testified that his nearly seventy
               years weighed heavily upon him.</p>
            <p>And yet, although Schnitzler felt his age very keenly, the realization brought him
               no pain or regret. He looked upon his old age, and the coming of death, with a philosophical
               stoicism which was as refreshing as it was beautiful. »<a id="K_I091-43"><!--anchor--></a>Younger men than I have been known to die<span class="note" id="K_I091-43h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Zitat von </span>,« he said to me softly and peacefully – and I could clearly see that the contemplation
               of death held no terror for him. »I have worked hard during my life, and when the
               time comes, I am ready to go. Of course, as long as life is spared me, there will
               be more and more work for me to do. I am at the very present moment at work upon three
               books and, should they be fated to reach completion, I shall begin work on other books.
               However, I am always ready to drop my pen because I know that I have worked wisely
               and well during a lifetime. My conscience, at least, is clear in that direction.«</p>
            <p>Schnitzler lived in the outskirts of Vienna – in a luxurious villa on <a id="T_I091-111"><!--anchor--></a> Sternwartestrasse <span class="note" id="T_I091-111h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘Sternwarterstrasse’</span></span> – which peeps out upon the glorious nearby Vienna woods. Here he used to stay the
               greater part of his time, working with an industry astonishing for a man so old and
               so famous. In the back of his home there extends a tremendous garden – a Wiener-Wald
               in miniature – in which Schnitzler, on pleasant days, did his literary work. Winter
               and unfavorable weather found him in his study, on the second floor of his home, almost
               always alone. For when Schnitzler was deep in work upon a new book he never permitted
               anyone to disturb him during working hours. His food was served in his study, and
               not even his family was permitted to interrupt him for any reason.</p>
            <p>He was a very careful, slow literary worker. Although he invariably worked upon two
               or three books at one time, each book received the most minute and scrupulous attention.
               Every page of his was revised dozens of times, and when a book was at last completed
               it was put aside for six months or a year, after which it underwent another minute
               and careful revision. It took an overwhelming amount of effort, pain and work to create
               any part of a Schnitzler story. That is why, perhaps, each of his works – even his
               earliest ones – are such cameos of artistic perfection.</p>
            <p>From where did Schnitzler get his literary material? The slightest scene, the most
               minute episode was sufficient to inflame his vivid imagination into a mighty and uncontrollable
               conflagration. A nude girl, running through some wild growth on the outskirts of Vienna,
               brought innumerable little questions to Schnitzler’s alert mind. The answer to those
               questions was <span class="italics">Fraulein Else</span>. Another out-of-the-way episode – a chance remark by an acquaintance at a cafe –
               made possible his <a id="K_I091-455"><!--anchor--></a><span class="italics">None But the Brave</span><span class="note" id="K_I091-455h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Lieutenant Gustl, in der Übersetzung von Richard Leo Simon, erschienen <span class="date">1926</span> im Verlag Simon  Schuster</span>. And so, any little happening was possible material for a complex novel. And his
               notebooks and files were overcrowded with such little incidents! Who can tell how
               these unimportant episodes would have been translated into classics under Schnitzler’s
               touch had life been granted him for a few more years?</p>
