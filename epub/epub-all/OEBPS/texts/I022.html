                  aus dem Jahr <span class="date">1916</span> () und fügt einen Satz hinzu; die Buchausgabe bringt stattdessen folgende Einleitung:
                  »<span class="quote">‘<span class="foreign" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">I met Arthur Schnitzler in his study in Vienna. A fine copy of Mona Lisa was conspicuous
                        among the numerous portraits on the walls, and on his desk stood a statuette of Goethe.
                        The brilliant Viennese dramatist and novelist, whose sixtieth birthday was recently
                        celebrated by his friends and admirers, is youthful despite the gray in his hair and
                        beard, and his kindly smile is as full of charm as ever. During the past few months
                        many eulogies by the foremost dramatists, novelists and critics appeared in various
                        European periodicals and newspapers. / Schnitzler is beloved by all who know him.
                        All agree that his artistic works are marked with a peculiar charm and are of lasting
                        value. He has portrayed men and women as they really are – with their dreams and their
                        passions, their foibles and their follies. / Gerhardt Hauptmann, summing up the achievements
                        of Schnitzler thus far, writes that to have an appreciation of Schnitzler is to have
                        an appreciation of art and culture. Hermann Bahr <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> predicts that Schnitzler will fare better than other writers a hundred years hence,
                        for when future generations will want to study the traits, the modes of life and thought
                        during the years of Austria’s sunset, they will have to go back to Schnitzler who
                        mirrored that sunset most clearly, who reproduced as no one else the last charm of<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e216">[Page]</span> <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> Vienna in the shadows, who was the doctor at her death bed, who loved her more deeply
                        than anyone else, who was the last poet of her agony. / Schnitzler spoke with deep
                        emotion of Austria’s pathetic plight, of the beauty and grandeur of her landscapes
                        and of her still undeveloped opportunities, of the curse of too much politics in Austria,
                        and for that matter in the whole of Europe, and then he pointed to the growth of prejudice
                        and hate after the war.</span>’</span>«. Von gesondertem Interesse sind die beiden erwähnten Kunstwerke. Schnitzler dürfte
                  die Kopie der Mona Lisa in Originalgröße noch vor der Popularisierung des Kunstwerks
                  durch einen spektakulären Diebstahl aus dem Louvre<span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span><span class="date">1911</span> erworben haben. Sie ist noch auf den letzten Fotos seines Arbeitszimmers zu erkennen.
                  (<span class="bibl">Vgl. <span class="titlem">A. S. und die bildende Kunst</span> 110–111</span>.) Die Keramikstatue von Powolny ist auch in einem anderen Interview erwähnt, . Die
                  Texte Hauptmanns und Bahrs, auf die Bezug genommen werden, erschienen beide im Schnitzler
                  gewidmeten Heft der Neuen Rundschau vom <span class="date">Mai 1922</span>.</span> <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> Henryk Ibsen was to the Norwegian drama, August Strindberg to the Swedish, Anton
               Chekhov to the Russian, what Gerhardt Hauptmann is to the German drama, Bernard Shaw
               to the English and Maurice Maeterlinck to the French, Arthur Schnitzler is to the
               Austrian drama to-day. Keen and penetrating, brilliant and subtle, a master of irony
               and satire, yet sincere and full of optimism, this master builder of the modern Austrian
               drama, this Viennese man of letters has impressed himself profoundly upon the literature
               of Austria in the face of innumerable difficulties.</p>
            <p>By the sheer force of his art, as it manifested itself in his works, in masterpiece
               after masterpiece, Dr. Arthur Schnitzler, a Jew, has won distinction in Vienna, the
               very hotbed of anti-semitism. He has surmounted many obstacles, combating prejudice
               calmly, yet with firm determination.</p>
            <p>The following interview was had in the study of this brilliant writer in Vienna:</p>
            <p>»What is becoming of Europe?« said Schnitzler. »The hate which has been intensified
               by the war is growing and spreading, and the most dreadful feature of it all is that
               people are talking of now wars in the near future.</p>
            <p><a id="KT108-2"><!--anchor--></a>»It<span class="note" id="KT108-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>In der Buchausgabe beginnt der Absatz mit: »<span class="quote">‘<span class="foreign" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">›On <span class="date">August 1, 1914</span>, – on the day of the declaration of war – I wrote a letter to my brother of which
                        I should have been ashamed a little later. I gave him my reasons why it was impossible
                        that such a world war could take place. It was a foolish letter in view of the events
                        that followed so rapidly, and that involved practically the whole world in the war.
                        But only now – after several years of so-called peace, we see clearly that the war
                        was really impossible.</span>’</span>«</span> was the most brutal of all wars, it destroyed more values than <a id="K_I022-45"><!--anchor--></a>any previous war<span class="note" id="K_I022-45h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>In der Buchausgabe ist der Satz erweitert um: »<span class="quote">‘and it has left the world in a much worse condition than it was before the war.’</span>«</span>. We see chaos, poverty, ruination everywhere in Europe. And we see more hate than
               before the war.</p>
            <p>»To check this spread of hate in various countries, it seems to me that it is urgent
               for intellectual leaders everywhere to create good will and a better understanding
               among the nations. A great campaign of education is essential in that direction.</p>
            <p>»We have seen that Socialism has failed to meet the problems of war and peace effectively
               and has not exerted much of an influence either in the war or in the making of peace.</p>
            <p>»We must realise, first of all, that man is the worst of all animals – the most cruel
               of them all. The difference between the human being and other animals is that the
               human being possesses such traits as joy at <a id="T_I022-11"><!--anchor--></a>another’s<span class="note" id="T_I022-11h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘anoher’s’</span></span> misfortune. Animals have no such terrible traits.</p>
            <p>»We must also realise that while the human mind may be improved by education the human
               soul cannot be improved – for it cannot be changed. We may, therefore, hope that human
               beings will some day become wiser, but they cannot become better. Human beings are
               born egotists. They do not love one another unselfishly – they hate one another.</p>
            <p>»All we may hope for is that the intellectual leaders may succeed in showing the people
               that they must stop wars because it would be best for them to have no wars – because
               they would benefit more from peace than from war.</p>
            <p>»Pacifism should not be sentimental. That is useless. Pacifists should not say that
               it is wrong to kill; that it is unethical to destroy human life; that it is immoral
               to commit such a crime; that other people suffer from such destruction, and that war
               is terrible on that account.</p>
            <p>»Everybody knows that war is terrible; that it leaves dead and maimed in its wake;
               that it destroys property, and retards what is known as civilization. But such methods
               of reasoning, such arguments are of no avail. Human beings are not impressed by them.
               Human beings do not change their nature on that account.</p>
            <p>»Instead of sentimental pacifism it is essential to convince them by education that
               peace would benefit them and save them – that in a roundabout way they themselves
               or their children may be the victims of war – the wounded, the mutilated, the dead.</p>
            <p>»It is of very little value to preach love and the brotherhood of man, for it does
               not help. There are some people who believe that it is enough for them to preach or
               to listen to sermons on loving one’s neighbor as themselves – and that by this they
               have already discharged all their duties to their fellow-men.</p>
            <p>»The quality of unselfish love is not inherent in human beings – and it is useless
               to demand of human beings to change that which cannot be changed. Besides, it is not
               necessary at all. I do not want people to love me. I do not want their kisses. I don’t
               think it necessary that there should be too much love among the nations.</p>
            <p>»The important thing is that people should realize that they must not wrong one another
               – that they must not hurt or injure one another. The important thing is that people
               should have the opportunity to work, undisturbed, in peace; that they should not interfere
               with others; that they should not destroy others; that they should not rob others.
               They must learn to realise that war will affect them directly in some way or other
               just as they believe war would affect their enemy, their neighbor.</p>
            <p>»Yesterday, while my daughter was packing to go to the country, we found a batch of
               old newspapers published during the war. I looked at the headlines. ›The Battle of – .‹<span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span>›We Captured 50,000 men. Tens of Thousands Slain.‹ And the jubilation over each victory!
               I remember how our people rejoiced when they heard that thousands of Russians were
               drowned in swamps.</p>
            <p>»I was filled with terror as I recalled all this. Of course, the other side did exactly
               the same. They too, rejoiced when hundreds of thousands of our people were slaughtered.
               And I recalled with horror the indifference with which people afterwards read about
               those battles.</p>
            <p>»When, for instance, they read that fifty thousand men had been slain, and on the
               following morning the revised figures showed that instead of fifty thousand there
               really were sixty thousand casualties, did that difference disturb the people’s sleep,
               or did it affect their appetites? Not in the least. They went on eating, drinking
               and smoking their cigars.</p>
            <p>»In fact, the men at the front hated the ›enemy‹ less than the people in the rear
               – we know that at the front the men often fraternized with the ›enemy,‹ while the
               people in the rear hated the ›enemy‹ intensely – and this hate is continuing. And
               in certain places it is even encouraged deliberately – fanned and spread <a id="KT108-3"><!--anchor--></a>artificially.<span class="note" id="KT108-3h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>In der Buchausgabe folgt ein weiterer Absatz: »<span class="quote">‘<span class="foreign" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">›If we read about some distant island sinking into the ocean with a population of
                        a half a million human beings we would actually be affected by such news much less
                        than by the natural death of someone on our block. If a fire breaks out in our neighbor’s
                        house, we are upset and worried to the extent that we fear lest the fire should spread
                        to our own house. If a fire breaks out somewhere in our city, we are worried because
                        it may destroy the house of one of our relatives or friends. If we hear of a fire
                        in a distant part of our city where we have no relatives or friends, we go on smoking
                        our cigars undisturbed.</span>’</span>«</span></p>
            <p>»I recall a simple, quite unimportant incident, but it is so characteristic that I
               will tell it to you. Some years ago my wife had scarlet fever. We had a <a id="K_implied_27740"><!--anchor--></a> nurse <span class="note" id="K_implied_27740h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>nicht identifiziert. Die Erkrankung bestand im <span class="date">Dezember 1907</span>.</span> who attended her. The nurse was very correct, devoted, efficient and intelligent.</p>
            <p>»When my wife recovered and the nurse was to leave, she had to wait about a quarter
               of an hour for an ambulance which was to fumigate her clothes in order that she may
               not infect other people.</p>
            <p>»When I went out of the house a few minutes later, I noticed to my great amazement
               that the nurse entered a crowded street car, without having waited for the ambulance.
               She had no patience to wait fifteen minutes, and she went home by car without having
               taken the necessary precaution. She probably infected a number of people in that car
               with scarlet fever.</p>
            <p>»Here was a nurse who knew well the dangers of such contagion. She was intelligent
               and it was her profession to look after patients, and be careful. But that did not
               matter to her. She went into the crowded street car because the passengers were just
               ordinary people whom she did not know. They were strangers to her, and she did not
               care.</p>
            <p>»But if, for instance, she were to learn that someone was infected in that car by
               her, and that such person carried the disease to a child who happened to be a schoolmate
               of her own child, and in that way infected her own child – and her own child died
               as a result, of her recklessness and neglect, then she would think and act differently
               in the future.</p>
            <p>»Of course, if such a thing happened, people would say that it was an unusual case,
               a rare coincidence. But if people were to figure things out logically they would find
               that the wrong they do to others in some way or other necessarily reacts on themselves
               – they would understand that, and would stop wronging others. As I have said before,
               human beings may become wiser, but they will never grow better.</p>
            <p>»It is therefore the important task of intellectual leaders everywhere to organise
               themselves and start a campaign to enlighten the people that peace is in their own
               interests – that war will ruin them, while peace will <a id="KT108-4"><!--anchor--></a>benefit them.«<span class="note" id="KT108-4h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Die Buchausgabe hat hier vier weitere Absätze: »<span style="display:block" class="quote blockquote"><span style="display:block" class="p"><span class="foreign" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">›Why don’t you develop this idea more elaborately in an article?‹ I suggested.</span></span> <span style="display:block" class="p"><span class="foreign" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"><span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e490">[Page]</span>›I can’t write articles,‹ replied Dr. Schnitzler. ›I have often been asked to write

                           and he often said to me: ›Let me have an article on this subject. This is just what
                           I need.‹ I have always declined to write articles. I often wonder why journalists
                           and publicists underestimate their own ability to write articles and believe that
                           novelists or dramatists must necessarily know how to write articles.‹</span></span> <span style="display:block" class="p"><span class="foreign" xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US">›But in this instance you have advanced the best reasons why you should write something

            <p>Our conversation turned to his dramatic works. Suddenly he asked:</p>
            <p>»How would you account for the fact that <a id="K_I022-1"><!--anchor--></a>some of my plays<span class="note" id="K_I022-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>das trifft nur auf Reigen zu</span> which were written twenty or twenty-five years ago are being produced only now? They
               seem to attract more attention now than when I wrote them.«</p>
            <p>»Your works were at least a quarter of a century ahead of their time,« I answered,
               »Only now people are beginning to understand and appreciate them fully.«</p>
            <p>When I mentioned »Reigen,« his sex play which created a sensation last year in Berlin
               and Vienna and which was at first suppressed by the German censor, Schnitzler remarked
               modestly:</p>
            <p>»›Reigen‹ is an ordinary play. The dialogues were written more than twenty-five years-ago.
               When this play of mine will long have been forgotten, the record of the Berlin trial
               connected with ›Reigen‹ will live. The <a id="KT108-5"><!--anchor--></a>stenographic report<span class="note" id="KT108-5h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span></span> of the testimony at that trial is the most amazing satire of our time. The four or
               five figures that revealed themselves in that extraordinary document are types of
               hypocrisy that the greatest of satirists could hardly have invented or improved upon.«</p>
