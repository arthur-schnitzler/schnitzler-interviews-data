            <p>The news that the Grillparzer prize had been awarded to Dr. Arthur Schnitzler was
               welcomed by all those who take real interest in the dramatic future of Austria, for
               though Grillparzer is the greatest of her poets and dramatists, it has rarely fallen
               to the lot of an Austrian to be the recipient of the coveted prize; which is the greatest
               distinction that a modern German dramatist can attain. Dr. Arthur Schnitzler is not
               only an Austrian and a Viennese, but a Jew, and one who is not ashamed of his Judaism.
               Of course, this fact has given rise to much adverse criticism on the part of the anti-Semitic
               Press, but, after all, it is not to them that men of culture go for information and
               advice, and their views may be ignored with a clear conscience. The Grillparzer prize
               was founded by the Akademie der Wissenschaft during the life of Grillparzer, who greatly
               appreciated the honour shown to him. It was his express wish that it should be awarded
               once in three years for the best German drama which had been produced during that
               time. It is no barren honour, its monetary value varying from 3,000 to 5,000 Austrian
               kronen (Dr. Schnitzler gained the larger sum). Another condition was that the drama
               must have been produced successfully at a leading German theatre. Since <span class="date">1887</span>, when the prize fell to Anzengruber, who died two years later, no Austrian has gained
               the coveted honour. It is exactly ten years since Schnitzler’s drama »Der grüne Kakadu«
               was successfully produced at the Imperial Hofburg (it has now gone over to the Volks
               Theater). This one-act drama, which deals with events taking place on the eve of the
               French revolution, is exceedingly powerful in dramatic effect, language and diction.
               It is now being produced by <a id="KT095-1"><!--anchor--></a> <a id="TT095-2"><!--anchor--></a>Baumfeld<span class="note" id="TT095-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘Barmfeld’</span></span> <span class="note" id="KT095-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Es handelte sich um die deutschsprachige Inszenierung von Der grüne Kakadu, Die letzten
                  Masken und Literatur am Irving Theatre (Premiere am <span class="date">29. 10. 1907</span>).</span> in New York.</p>
            
            <p>The jurors had to study and debate upon the merits of no less than ninety-four plays
               before coming to a decision. It was no ordinary jury, composed as it was of Hofrat
               Minor, Professor of German Literature at the Vienna University; Ludwig Hevesi, the
               well-known art and dramatic critic; Hofrat Dr. Max Burckhard, the former director
               of the Imperial Hofburg; the present Director of the Imperial Theatre, Dr. Paul Schlenther;
               and Geheimrat Dr. Erich Schmidt, of Berlin, all men known throughout the literary
               world of Austria and Germany, and whose fame has gone far beyond the boundaries of
               these countries. Professor Dr. Eduard Suess, the President of the Akademie der <a id="T_I009-11"><!--anchor--></a>Wissenschaften<span class="note" id="T_I009-11h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘Wissenschaft’</span></span>, was highly pleased with the result of the Conference, for Dr. Schnitzler was chosen
               unanimously for his drama, »Zwischenspiel.«</p>
            
            <p>Dr. Schnitzler is but a young man, being a little over forty. He did not begin to
               write anything seriously till he was over thirty, but his career has been both interesting
               and successful. His father was a distinguished medical man, a specialist and Professor
               of laryngology, whose services were sought far and near, and who achieved a world-wide
               fame. His brother, Dr. Julius Schnitzler, is likewise distinguished as a surgeon.
               He is first surgeon of the Rudolfspital and Professor of Surgery at the University.
               His only sister is married to Dr. Marcusz Hajek, a widely-known specialist for the
               throat and ear; and lastly, Arthur Schnitzler is himself a medical man. As he says,
               he was brought up in the midst of medicine and it came to him naturally. After <a id="T_I009-2"><!--anchor--></a>having taken<span class="note" id="T_I009-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘having taking’</span></span> his <a id="K_I009-2"><!--anchor--></a>degree<span class="note" id="K_I009-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Die Promotion fand am <a class="link_ref"></a> statt.</span>, he <a id="K_I009-1"><!--anchor--></a>went to London<span class="note" id="K_I009-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>von <a class="link_ref"></a> bis zum <a class="link_ref"></a></span>, where he spent several months walking the hospitals and studying their systems.
               On his return to Vienna, he set up as a practitioner, won acknowledgment and was in
               the way of becoming a specialist like his father. Fortunately, his bent towards literature
               and the drama especially, were greater than his love for medicine, and he became a
               writer. His preparation bad been a wide one; not only had he travelled and seen the
               great cities of the Continent, but he bad also been a voracious reader. From the first
               he proved himself a writer of no mean talent, and his novels and dramas attained immediate
               popularity. One of his earliest stories, »Leutenant Gustl,« brought him into conflict
               with the military authorities and cost him his rank as Lieutenant in the Reserve.
               It is twelve years since his first drama, »<a id="TT095-1"><!--anchor--></a> Liebelei <span class="note" id="TT095-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘Lieberlei’</span></span>,« was produced at the Imperial Hofburg Theater. This at once gained him fame, and,
               with few exceptions, all his dramas have been successfully produced on this stage.
               For some reason or other, »Der Schleier der Beatrice« was censored in Vienna, but
               it was, nevertheless, produced. Schnitzler has even met with more appreciation in
               Berlin than in Vienna, but »a man is never a prophet in his own country,« and Vienna
               is Austria. He possesses a fine and cultivated intellect, keen, perceptive faculties,
               natural warmth, and poetic fire and expression. He is Viennese to the core, with all
               that charm and grace for which inhabitants of the Austrian capital are celebrated.
               He is essentially a modern dramatist; what he says is trenchant and to the point,
               though he is never coarse. The prize drama, »Zwischenspiel,« deals with the modern
               marriage question, and the relation of the wife to her husband and to her lover. He
               treats the question with real earnestness.</p>
            
            <p>Schnitzler’s diction is flowing and sonorous, his language easy and musical. Needless
               to say, Dr. Schnitzler takes a warm interest in all questions of the day and all that
               concerns Judaism. He hopes for a solution of the anti-Semitic question, and treats
               of it in his serial romance »<span class="italics">Der Weg ins freie</span>,« which is now appearing in <span class="italics"><a id="T_I009-1"><!--anchor--></a>Die Neue</span><span class="note" id="T_I009-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘Der Neue’</span></span><span class="italics">Rundschau</span>, but it is impossible to criticise his views till the story is completed. It will
               be published in book form in <span class="date">August</span>. He is also interested in the Zionist movement, though he takes no active part in
               it.</p>
            
            <p>Add to all that has been said, that he is about middle stature, fair and with charming
               manners and withal a modest man, and you have a complete picture of Dr. Arthur Schnitzler.</p>
