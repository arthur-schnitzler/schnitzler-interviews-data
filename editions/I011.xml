            <head type="sub">By David Ewen</head>
            <p>Now, that <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur Schnitzler</rs>, the famous German
               novelist and playwright, is growing old his deepest regret is that he has never
               visited <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs>. It is true that men far older than
               he have successfully made the trip across the ocean. Only recently, Sir <rs
                  type="person" ref="#5194">George Henschel</rs>, the <rs type="place" ref="#254"
                  >English</rs> composer and conductor came here to help the <rs type="org"
                  ref="#29427">Boston Symphony Orchestra</rs>, celebrate its fiftieth anniversary –
               and Sir <rs type="person" ref="#5194">George</rs> has already seen his eightieth
               year. A man, however, is as old as he feels – and, though <rs type="person"
                  ref="#2121">Arthur Schnitzler</rs> is only sixty-eight, he feels much, much,
               older. His face is deeply wrinkled. His eyes are dull and appear sad and tired over
               heavy bags, he walks with a heavy gait and with stooped back. In spirit and in flesh
               he is already an old man.</p>
            <p>But though he is old and feels that death cannot be very far away, there is by no
               means any melancholy or despair in him.</p>
            <p><ref target="#q168" type="question"/><anchor type="label" xml:id="I011_L2_todie"/>»Younger men than I have been known to die,« he said softly and peacefully – one
               could easily see that the contemplation of death did not frighten him in the least.
               »I have worked hard during my life, and when the time comes I am quite prepared to
               go. Of course, as long as life is spared me so long will there be more and more work
               for me to complete. My pen is never idle. I am now working on three books, and should
               it be fated that I complete them all I shall gladly begin work on others. However, I
               am always ready to drop my pen, because I feel and know that I have lived both wisely
               and well during my lifetime. At least my conscience in that direction is clear.«</p>
            <head type="sub">
               <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> Today Is <rs type="place" ref="#468"
                  >Europe</rs> Tomorrow</head>
            <p><ref target="#q130" type="question"/>And a moment, later he added, as though in afterthought: »But I do have one deep
               regret. My greatest sorrow at present is that I have never visited your remarkable
                  <rs type="place" ref="#175">country</rs>, and therefore have never had the
               enviable opportunity of seeing it and studying it at first hand. And, unfortunately,
               I am now too old to remedy this!«</p>
            <p><anchor type="label" xml:id="I011_L1_bookcase"></anchor>We were sitting on the comfortably soft couch in <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur
                  Schnitzler’s</rs> charming study. The walls are <anchor type="textConst"
                  xml:id="T_I011-1"/>covered<note type="textConst" xml:id="T_I011-1h"
                     ><quote>cov</quote></note> with bookcases heavily lined with books. One of
               these bookcases, modestly covered by a velvet curtain, contains all of <rs
                  type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur Schnitzler</rs>’s works in all translated
               languages. The one window of the room looks out upon a luxuriously fertile <anchor type="commentary" xml:id="K_I011-1"/>garden,
               where during the spring, summer and early autumn Dr. <rs type="person" ref="#2121"
                  >Schnitzler</rs> does all of his writing<note type='commentary' xml:id="K_I011-1h">das dürfte er nicht gesagt haben; die Aussage, dass er nicht im Freien
                     arbeite, ist wahrscheinlich richtig: <ref target="#I072_L1_gartenarbeit" type="pointer"/></note>. It was rapidly becoming dusk, and the
               room – as we were talking – was becoming suffused with a serene, mellow darkness. <rs
                  type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> did not trouble putting on the light. He
               was buried in the softness of the couch and he was quietly speaking to me about <rs
                  type="place" ref="#175">America</rs>.</p>
            <p><ref target="#q169" type="question"/>»I have no illusions about <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> being something
               of a Utopia in the miniature,« he said, »for I well know that it is nothing of the
               sort. But <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> interests me profoundly – and has
               interested me for many years already – because it obviously points the way to the
               future. Whether we are at harmony with this future or not; whether, even, this future
               is a desirable one, is beside the point – nor is it a question I would care
               particularly to discuss now. The fact remains that this future is almost inevitable,
               and whether we like it or not we must accept it. Tomorrow <rs type="place" ref="#468"
                  >Europe</rs> will be what <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> is today – and
               if we are interested in ourselves we must inevitably be interested in <rs
                  type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> too. You have led the way in industry,
               politics and finance. I frankly feel that it will not be very long before you will
               likewise lead the way in matters artistic too.</p>
            <head type="sub">Says <rs type="place" ref="#468">Europe</rs> Lacks Our Vigor In
               Literature</head>
            <p><ref target="#q169" type="question"/>»From what I have heard and from what I have read I have gathered the fact that <rs
                  type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> is creating a new, unique form of art and
               culture – a type uniquely its own and one which strongly points toward being the art
               and culture of the future. That is why I was so eager to visit <rs type="place"
                  ref="#175">America</rs>, to try to feel its atmosphere and spirit and to try,
               perhaps, to understand it. Unfortunately, I procrastinated too long.«</p>
            <p>Dr. Schnitzler was speaking about our unique art. Was he, perhaps, acquainted with
               our literature?</p>
            <p><ref target="#q170" type="question"/>»Quite naturally, many of your writers have time and again come to my notice – and
               from time to time I have come across much that impressed me very, very deeply. Names
               at the moment elude me. But I can say, at the very least, that you have two
               outstanding great novelists, and certainly at least one profound dramatist. Both <rs
                  type="person" ref="#6859">Theodore Dreiser</rs> and <rs type="person" ref="#60597"
                  >Sinclair Lewis</rs> (Note: At the time of the conversation it was not yet known
               that <rs type="person" ref="#60597">Sinclair Lewis</rs> was the <rs type="org"
                  ref="#29679">Nobel prize</rs> winner) have contributed something new and original
               to the novel. We <rs type="place" ref="#468">Europeans</rs> find a vigor and vitality
               in both <rs type="person" ref="#6859">Dreiser</rs> and <rs type="person" ref="#60597"
                  >Lewis</rs> which is simply lacking over here. Such prose – palpitant and alive –
               could have come only from an <rs type="place" ref="#175">American</rs>. And such
               messages, as their novels express, are intrinsically <rs type="place" ref="#175"
                  >American</rs>. As for <rs type="person" ref="#5198">Eugene O’Neill</rs>, he is to
               me one of the greatest figures in contemporary drama. I personally, found his ›<rs
                  type="work" ref="#33191">Strange Interlude</rs>‹ to be prolix and outmoded; this
               business of the ›aside‹ is neither original nor of artistic importance, it seems to
               me. It is such a naive trick to tell what is in a character’s mind which a little bit
               of subtlety would have accomplished with far more aptness. But in his earlier plays –
               in ›<rs type="work" ref="#60603">All God's Chillun Got Wings</rs>‹, and in his ›<rs
                  type="work" ref="#60605">Emperor Jones</rs>‹ – he is a truly great figure. These
               plays grew out of <rs type="place" ref="#175">American</rs> soil. Their supreme
               strength lies not only in the fact that, taken from artistic standards, they are
               great plays, but also in the fact that these plays could not possibly have come from
               a <rs type="place" ref="#468">European</rs> pen. In the drama, as well as in the
               novel, <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> is now fully emancipated.</p>
            <p><ref target="#q169" type="question"/>»But what impresses me most about <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> is its
               remarkably experimental nature, it is constantly alert to new ideas and thoughts, far
               more alert than <rs type="place" ref="#468">Europe</rs> can hope to be. Take such
               inventions as the motion picture – and now the talking picture and the radio and, you
               will find that in <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> these have become in a
               bewilderingly short time, an integral part of <rs type="place" ref="#175"
                  >American</rs> life. Such open-mindedness to new things has, undoubtedly, given
                  <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> the reputation of constantly pursuing new
               fads. But this, far from being a regrettable state of affairs, is to me most
               commendable. It is a healthy condition in which it is comparatively easy to make
               gigantic strides forward in the future in scientific and artistic matters. It is the
               proper soil in which fruit can blossom with most fertility.</p>
            <p><ref target="#q171" type="question"/>»You say in <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> that the drama is dying? To me,
               of course, such a fear is ridiculous. An art can never die. True, drama, because of
               certain inevitable conditions, is in a sort of stagnancy: fluctuating periods of
               stagnation and fertility are inevitable in the life of every art. But to say it is
               dead, especially when you <rs type="place" ref="#175">Americans</rs> have a man like
                  <rs type="person" ref="#5198">Eugene O’Neill</rs> in your midst, is futile
               pessimism.</p>
            <p><ref target="#q172" type="question"/>»Talking pictures can never replace the spoken drama. I do not deny the importance of
               the talking picture as a new type of artistic expression – but it is a type of
               artistic expression different from the spoken drama. Talking pictures may supplement
               the drama, but they will never supplant it. At its best it will be eighth lively art
               – and an art in which. I am confident. <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> will
               prove to be supreme.«</p>
