            <p>In my editorial capacity I receive a great deal of European mail. Every few days of
               late have been learning by letter or from the foreign press that another Continental
               publishing company has gone to the wall. An old German publishing house writes: »Have
               you any suggestions as to how the American sale of our books can be stimulated? Germans
               have almost completely stopped buying books.« The head of some of the solidest German
               firms remarks in a burst of confidence that for the first time since his childhood
               he could not afford a summer vacation this season. A mild deprivation compared to
               the case of the French <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> <a id="K_implied_58317"><!--anchor--></a> novelist <span class="note" id="K_implied_58317h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>nicht identifiziert</span> who died of starvation a year or two ago and that of the once-famous Czech <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> <a id="KT142-1"><!--anchor--></a> dramatist <span class="note" id="KT142-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>der in Teplitz geborene Dietzenschmidt</span> who is subsisting on charity.

            <p>In the course of considerable correspondence on the subject I have received from Europe
               some very interesting <a id="K_M056-1"><!--anchor--></a>comment<span class="note" id="K_M056-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Die Beiträge erschienen in folgender Reihe: Leon Lemonnier, Luc Durtain, Gustav Frenssen,

            <p>The wisest and kindest of living Austrian Writers has concrete suggestions. Dr. Arthur
               Schnitzler writes:</p>
            <p><span style="display:inline-block" width="1line"> </span></p>
            <p>»The shortest and simplest means of helping the situation is by direct aid to the
               needy writers. More important – and in a higher sense – would, of course, be a <a id="K_M056-11"><!--anchor--></a>reform of the copyright law<span class="note" id="K_M056-11h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span></span>, or at least a careful observance of the existing law, which, as you know, is not
               now the case. It is unfortunately true that spiritual property has never been put
               on the same plane before the law as material property, and so it is constantly happening
               that direct infractions of existing law are not adequately punished or not at all,
               so that the most disgraceful offenders against the regulations concerning spiritual
               property are allowed to go free, not merely unpunished, but even as highly respected
               citizens. But these things cannot be changed overnight, and even if they were changed
               there will always remain a certain number of writers who would have difficulty in
               earning a living, if they were paid respectably</p>
