               </rs>, <date>February 12</date>. – A drama of tempestuous love has brought about what
               verges on a Ministerial crisis here, and events during the last two days in that
               august body, the <rs type="place" ref="#776">Austrian Parliament</rs>, have been
               themselves dramatic.</p>
            <p>On Thursday <rs type="place" ref="#776">Parliament</rs> heard the amazing news that
               the current deficit exceeds 42 milliards of crowns. One would have supposed that this
               disclosure of appalling bankruptcy would have set the Assembly agog. But no. Members
               took it calmly – in fact, with bored indifference. There were a few stifled yawns, a
               brief mechanical debate, and the House passed to another topic.</p>
            <head type="sub">Forbidden</head>
            <p>Yesterday the same Parliament was informed that the play, »<rs type="work"
                  ref="#29855">Reigen</rs>,« which <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur
                  Schnitzler</rs> wrote 24 years ago, and which is now being produced in <rs
                  type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs>, has been forbidden by the Minister of the
               Interior, because it contains certain amorous scenes which exceed what this Clerical
               Government considers to be the limits of decorum.</p>
            <p>No sooner had the subject been broached than a veritable maelstrom engulfed the
               House. M. P.s pounded on benches, whistles and catcalls echoed from the opposing
               sides. Clerical and Socialist members moved toward each other with brandished fists
               and blows were <anchor type="textConst" xml:id="T_I083-1"/>exchanged.<note

            <head type="sub">Fiery Cross of Class War</head>
            <p>Cries of »the Minister of the Interior must go!« »Out with the rascal!« were
               heard.</p>
            <p>The Minister, Herr <rs type="person" ref="#17069">Glanz</rs>, replied by describing
               the Socialists as the protectors of indecency, to which <rs type="person"
                  ref="#10851">Otto Bauer</rs> objected vociferously. <rs type="person" ref="#12766"

               ex-President of the Republic, declared that if the Clericals are determined to employ
               violence the Socialists will retort with forcible resistance.</p>
            <p>The admission of the State’s insolvency had left the Government intact, but the
               Social Democrats, who have humbly accepted the miserable lot of the <rs type="place"
                  ref="#41240">Austrian</rs> worker as inevitable, are heard issuing a summons for
               armed class conflict because adultery is committed on a darkened theatrical
               stage.</p>

                  type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>’s production shall proceed unmolested.
               And so, naturally the play, which had been presented to modest audiences of
               aesthetes, is now being given before packed houses.</p>
            <p>»Is the author responsible for the public?« exclaimed Dr. <rs type="person"
                  ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>, when I interviewed him. »Shall I stand at the door
               and psycho-analyse each person entering the theatre to determine whether he is
               impelled there by erotic motives?«</p>
