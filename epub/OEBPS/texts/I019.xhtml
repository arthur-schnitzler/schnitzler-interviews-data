            <p>What Henryk Ibsen was to the Norwegian drama, August Strindberg to the Swedish, Anton
               Chekhov to the Russian, what Gerhardt Hauptmann is to the German drama, Bernard Shaw
               to the English and Maurice Maeterlinck to the French, Arthur Schnitzler is to the
               Austrian drama today. Keen and penetrating, brilliant and subtle, a master of irony
               and satire, yet sincere and full of optimism, this master builder of the modern Austrian
               drama, this Viennese man of letters has impressed himself profoundly upon the literature
               of Austria in the face of innumerable difficulties.</p>
            
            <p>By the sheer force of his art, as it manifested itself in his works, in masterpiece
               after masterpiece, Dr. Arthur Schnitzler, a Jew, has won distinction in Vienna, the
               very hotbed of antisemitism. He has surmounted many obstacles, combating prejudice
               calmly, yet with firm determination.</p>
            
            <p>Schnitzler is at his best when portraying women. Painting the mysteries of the enigmatic
               »eternal feminine« with a master brush, attacking the actualities of life in terms
               of life, he scales the heights of emotions and depicts the depths of depravity, analyzing
               human frailties and shortcomings, mercilessly at times, always fearlessly, yet never
               vulgarizing that which less gifted and less tactful dramatists and novelists delight
               in making vulgar.</p>
            
            <p>Whether it is in his »Anatol,« a series of dramatic episodes of love affairs, written
               in the beginning of his career in <span class="date">1880</span>, but not produced until a few years ago (given here at Maxine Elliott’s Theater,
               with Doris Keane in one of the characters); whether it is his »Amours« »The Lonely
               Way,« »The Intermezzo,« »The Far Away Country,« »The Fairy Tale«; or his one-act plays,
               »Literature,« »The Green Cockatoo«; or his more recent work, in the drama as well
               as in the novel and the short story, his analytical power, his wit and his brilliant
               dialogue, lift his work into a class all by itself in European literature. All his
               dramas are full of virility and deep understanding–different as they are in theme,
               varied as they are in treatment, broad as they are in conception. Schnitzler is never
               a slave to form or a servant of traditions and conventionalities. He is unique among
               Viennese dramatists; he is as characteristic as Vienna itself, as Viennese life, whose
               gifted interpreter he is.</p>
            
            <p>Schnitzler is known in America by a number of plays which have been produced here
               from time to time–»The Affairs of Anatol,« »The Fairy Tale,« »The Reckoning,« »Literature,«
               »The Countess Mizzi« and others. Now a <a id="KT105-1"><!--anchor--></a>volume<span class="note" id="KT105-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="bibl">The lonely way, Intermezzo, Countess Mizzi. Three plays by Arthur Schnitzler. Translated

            <p>Born in Vienna in <span class="date">May 15, 1862</span>, the son of a physician, Schnitzler first turned to medicine as his life work, but
               soon abandoned this for literature. He looks much younger than his years. Although
               depressed by the horrors of the European catastrophe, he is nevertheless optimistic
               as to the outcome of the war, believing that the universal peace movement will in
               time make war impossible.</p>
