            <p>You look at this city and regretfully wonder. Was there ever a <rs type="place"
                  ref="#50">Vienna</rs> of the <rs type="person" ref="#12867">Strauss</rs> waltzes?
               Of delectable cafés rivalling <rs type="place" ref="#182">Paris</rs>, whose coffee
               and rosette-like rolls of white flour sent the name <rs type="place" ref="#50"
                  >Vienna</rs> around the world? Were these boulevards ever gay at night with lights
               and music from every restaurant? Where is the bright-faced populace that flocked on
               Sundays to <rs ref="#40876" type="place">Wiener Wald</rs> at the first excuse for
               Spring? Is <rs type="person" ref="#11992">Kreisler</rs>’s »<rs type="work"
                  ref="#33225">Caprice Viennoise</rs>« mere fancy? And when you have studied the
               faces in the city of to-day you wonder most of all, was there ever a <rs type="place"
                  ref="#50">Vienna</rs> such as Dr. <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur
                  Schnitzler</rs>, physician, novelist and playwright, pictured in his »<rs

            <p>Yet that <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> must have existed once upon a time,
               lived and played with life and fashioned a city to its moods. For, although »<rs

                  ref="#11798">Ibsen</rs>-like freight of social significance in these little
               comedies, what has kept them alive so long?</p>
            <p>If, as it must be, there is in them the salt of truth, that <rs type="work"
                  ref="#29935">Anatol</rs> once really lived, and with him his city, then it is a
               much changed <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> to-day. The <rs type="place"
                  ref="#112">Ring</rs>, that girdle of boulevards that encircles the heart of the
               city, is still handsome in its way, ponderous with palaces and public buildings, and
               is still immaculately clean. In their regal days their architecture was less
               expressive of <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> than of a royalty that imitated
                  <rs type="place" ref="#206">Prussia</rs>. But now that these palaces are awkward
               with soup kitchens and offices, and somewhat shabby for lack of paint and repairs,
               palaces and people are more akin in mood. The outward aspect of the world you see on
               the <rs type="place" ref="#112">Ring</rs> during the day – at night there are few
               people and fewer lights – shows no remarkable poverty, although beggars are plentiful
               and startlingly theatrical. But it is only the outward aspect of the city you see on
               the <rs type="place" ref="#112">Ring</rs> – the employed, and those who don’t have to
               work, and foreigners. The real <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> of to-day has
               little heart for the boulevards; and in the back reaches of the city there is
               starvation.</p>
            <p>However, since <rs type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs>
               <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>
               <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have cafés, you see them crowded. On the tables there is
               plenty of drinking water, a little weak chocolate, spiritless beer, occasionally
               coffee, more often a substitute, and little or no sugar or milk. For those who can
               afford it a single sardine on a plate – two is a double portion – with a dab of
               mustard if you are willing to pay for it. Of bread, even the darkish mongrel kind,
               there is none, unless you are dining in some haunt of profiteers. The people sit
               beside these nominal excuses for refreshments, looking a little conscious of their
               worn clothes, for <rs type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs> know what it is to dress
               well. They glance through skimpy journals; paper costs enormously. They comment
               occasionally on this or that, and are mildly glad when the music strikes up.</p>
            <p>In the biggest cafés there is music; for musicians, like other professionals in <rs
                  type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs>, are plentiful and to be had cheaply. I know of
               a leather goods buyer from <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> who hired a
               quintet from a symphony orchestra to play for him a whole evening in his hotel room.
               With tips they cost him two and a half dollars, so low is the <rs type="place"
                  ref="#41240">Austrian</rs> krone. In the café you can have an excellent sketch in
               crayon made of yourself for twenty cents; thirty for a caricature by a man who will
               show you his work in the humorous weekly you are reading. The orchestra plays
               superbly and the applause is generous. But it all sounds hollow. Something is not
               there. A <rs type="person" ref="#12867">Strauss</rs>-like waltz you seldom hear. For
                  <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs>, like the rest of <rs type="place"
                  ref="#468">Europe</rs>, has turned to the popular music of <rs type="place"
                  ref="#175">America</rs>; <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs>, the young and
               vital when <rs type="place" ref="#468">Europe</rs> is so tired; <rs type="place"
                  ref="#175">America</rs> so overflowing with barbaric vitality that the jazz band
               is its expression. Tunes that ran their brief course in the <rs type="place"
                  ref="#175">United States</rs> two and three years ago bring real hand-clapping
               from the <rs type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs> to-day; and somehow even to an <rs
                  type="place" ref="#175">American</rs> they seem to have a surprising freshness and
               youth here.</p>
            <p>On Sundays the people still flock to <rs ref="#40876" type="place">Wiener Wald</rs>.
               But it is only to gather wood. The splendid forests, once the pride of the <rs
                  type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs> and loved for their green beauties, are being
               cut down for fuel; and you see people dragging logs of new wood for miles back to the
               city. Recently the park department ordered a general pruning of trees in the city,
               just to give the poor a chance to gather the twigs that fell.</p>
            <p>And as to the world of <rs type="work" ref="#29935">Anatol</rs> and his friends?</p>
            <p>I went to Dr. <rs type="person" ref="#2121">
                  <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>
               </rs> himself for news of them. The man who has caught the spirit of <rs type="place"
                  ref="#50">Vienna</rs>’s youth is numerically fifty-seven years old. He is rather
               square in build and therefore looks shorter than he is; but an aliveness that would
               mean youth at any age gives him dominance in any group. His gray-blue eyes are warm
               and bright. His ample brown hair and trimmed beard give no hint of his years in spite
               of the gray in them. He talks fast, well and buoyantly, constantly crowded from his
               theme by a swarm of shouldering memories. <rs type="person" ref="#11461">Goethe</rs>,
                  <rs type="person" ref="#12654">Schiller</rs>, <rs type="person" ref="#12053"
                  >Lessing</rs>, <rs type="person" ref="#11640">Heine</rs>, <rs type="person"
                  ref="#2381">George Bernard Shaw</rs> and <rs type="person" ref="#2412"
                  >Shakespeare</rs>, the last two in German as well as in English, and a host of
               other books look down from the shelves of handsome book cabinets. Through a panelled
               window I saw a glimpse of woods with a red sun setting behind the trees; in the other
               direction, down hill, the roofs of <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> itself. A
               white porcelain stove in a corner; dark rosewood furniture; a bowl of brilliant
               geraniums; framed prints on the wall, all took the warm twilight comfortably,
               endearingly.</p>
            <p>»The <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> of ›<rs type="work" ref="#29935"
                  >Anatol</rs>‹ lived in the late <date>’80</date>’s,« Dr. <rs type="person"
                  ref="#2121">
                  <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>
               </rs> said, answering my query. »It belonged to a time of economic ease and freedom
               from the weight of social problems clamoring for solution, a time when charming young
               idlers could bloom and thrive. It was largely then that the lighthearted, tuneful,
               gracefully living <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> of the foreigner’s
               imagination was nearest reality. You mention <rs type="person" ref="#12867"
                  >Strauss</rs> waltzes. <rs type="person" ref="#12867">Strauss</rs>’s music is only
               a waft of melody through a partly opened door. It happened that his compositions
               found favor in the world outside. <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> had other
               waltz music besides Strauss. Its mood was the mood of a sunny day in the spring,
               Sunday. Of course, there was the workaday world for the mass of <rs type="place"
                  ref="#50">Viennese</rs>. But it was not a grinding week in the main. Employment
               was not very scarce and good food and good light wines and beer not dear. And then,
               too, as soon as winter let<pb/> up there was <rs ref="#40876" type="place">Wiener
                  Wald</rs> to go to and play. The <rs type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs> are a
               most lovable people when the sun smiles. They have a veritable talent for laughing,
               for melody, for art, for the graces of life. When the sun smiles –« Dr. <rs

                  <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>
               </rs> repeated.</p>
            <p>»But one of the most characteristic traits of the <rs type="place" ref="#50"
                  >Viennese</rs> is changeableness of mood,« he continued. »And the modern world did
               not leave them free for long, free of the cares of maturity. From every side problems
               closed in on them – social, political, economic, racial problems which are breaking

               that <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> became a changed world. Possibly it is
               because I am much older that I see things differently. But I know many young men
               to-day. And it seems to me that the present generation is much different from that of
                  ›<rs type="work" ref="#29935">Anatol</rs>’s‹ day. It is made of sterner, solider
               stuff. It has been tempered by fire and hammered on the anvil of economic life. Our
               young men since the <date>80’s</date> have had to choose sides and fight in many a

               case of war between clericalism against agnosticism and atheism, capitalism against
               socialism, militarism against its antagonists – why, then the battleground is often
               in the heart and mind and family of the young fellow himself. It is no longer a
               question of yielding to contagion. It becomes a matter of heart searching, bitter
               conflict in the home, in the workshop, in the circle of friends where formerly you
               found only the problem of what to play. Strikes and election campaigns, mass
               demonstrations and repression, military abuse and the hatreds they bred – these were
               the matters that soon took up the time and thoughts and emotions of our young people.
               Oh, they kept on playing, too, of course. They will never stop playing. That is in
               the bone and blood of the <rs type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs>. But they no
               longer played with life.</p>
            <p>»You see, the city itself developed like a too fast growing child. In
                  <date>1850</date> it was a comparatively small affair surrounded by a fortress.
               The <rs type="place" ref="#112">Ring</rs>, which is now the main artery of the city,
               was then only country, a free place, a road. Why, as late as <date>1890</date>

               <rs type="place" ref="#302">Mariahilferstrasse</rs> was a suburb. To-day it is one of
               the busiest of <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs>’s business streets. The city
               grew too fast for its small clothes. New demands were made on hearts too young to
               meet them. The result was worry, confusion, the punishments of life on all mistakes
               of immaturity. From much of this <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> has
               recovered. But it has not recovered its unthinking youth, its untroubled gayety.</p>
            <p>»You must remember that to begin with <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> was not
               quite so light as the world imagines it.« Dr. <rs type="person" ref="#2121">

               </rs> had constantly to retrace his characterizations. It was interesting to see in
               him the impulse to sketch a character or a situation with a striking figure of
               speech, and to see that impulse overtaken, checked and corrected by the equally
               strong passion to present the same subject in all its fullness and complexity. »Along

            <p>»In one respect <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> has had a hard time growing
               up. It finds it hard to take itself or others seriously, particularly itself. North
                  <rs type="place" ref="#151">Germany</rs>, for example, has always found <rs
                  type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> amusing. Well, our people took that as their
               cue too. It became the fashion for our correspondents to foreign newspapers to poke
               fun at everything <rs type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs>. The result was that no
               native talent was prophetic among our people. Now there is a great deal of fine
               talent among them. But it has a hard time getting itself appreciated here – until it
               has received approval abroad. <rs type="person" ref="#12163">Gustave Mahler</rs>

               seemed to me an astounding achievement. It was a matter of lines of crayon on paper.

               flexing and turning with the half asleep comfort of that young person.</p>

               from it and to think clearly events came rushing like a mountainslide. Of course they
               were largely manipulated; and still more they had their momentum in great economic

            <p>»I feel that our people have no love for militarism and that, left to themselves,

               fly or not? Some people, notably the very rich – their very wealth seems to breed a
               cowardice – did fly in their autos. But in the main <rs type="place" ref="#50"
                  >Vienna</rs> stayed. Some out of pride; others because of fatalism; many because

                  ref="#50">Viennese</rs>. Every engagement in the field sent us back a flood of
               dead and wounded. Those who had stayed behind to work staggered under unremitting
               overwhelming burdens. But of actual physical want in the city there was little until
                  <date>1915</date>, when bread cards were first given out. Even then the prices did
               not rise badly. So that while our people had superimposed them the weight of war,
               they still had their old <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> to help them forget a
               little.</p>
            <p>»Then in <date>1917</date>
               <space unit="chars" quantity="1"/>
               <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> began to lose its lights. That was bad.
               Theatres began to close early. Even to-day performances must close at eight. And <rs

               long evening at the theatre is not itself. Worse still was the early closing hour for
               our street railways. Our people are tremendously social, gregarious. Send them to bed
               early and you make them suffer, as the young always suffer when they are sent to bed
               early. Then on top of that came the endless mounting of carfare, until to-day it
               costs something like many times what it used to cost. Our people can no longer afford
               to visit their friends at any distance, to go to theatres, to cafés.</p>
            <p>»Deprived of their familiar escape, from the crushing realities of life the <rs
                  type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs> became a changed people – confused, heavy,
               spiritless, pondering. A new and terrible experience crept in on them – hunger. One
               after another food stocks of every kind became exhausted; on the other hand, prices
               went soaring so high that thinking in terms of money took on a kind of craziness. The
               familiar world assumed fantastic proportions. One saw everywhere the giddiness that
               comes of slow starvation. Great events came to mean little; a crust of bread, a
               broken shoe, a spell of freezing weather, everything. Even the end of fighting in the
               field brought no actual relief. Food stock still went on sinking; prices soared still
               higher. The <rs type="place" ref="#41240">Austrian</rs> krone could buy almost
               nothing from abroad. The foreigner came and bought everything in <rs type="place"
                  ref="#41240">Austria</rs> for practically nothing – and at his coming prices
               leaped up and up.</p>
            <p>»It became a tremendously profitable thing to smuggle in food from the country and to
               sell it at illegal rates to the foreigner and the profiteer. The farmer who had food
               kept it from the open market for the <hi rend="italics">schleichhändler</hi>, who
               paid him exorbitant prices and still made a huge profit. Our people saw their own
               children starving. And in the big hotels and restaurants, on the <rs type="place"
                  ref="#112">Ring</rs> and before the <rs type="place" ref="#15">Opera House</rs>,
               they saw overfed, bejewelled, fur-clad <hi rend="italics">schiebers</hi> (profiteers)
               and <hi rend="italics">schleichhändler</hi> rolling in opulence. It made our people
               exceedingly bitter.«</p>
            <p>»How is it they don’t take stones and smash in the windows of hotels and restaurants
               and help themselves?« I asked.</p>
            <p>»Well, for one thing, the <rs type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs> is not the
               explosive kind. Physical violence is rather repulsive to him. Another reason,
               however, is that it is not the proletariat who have suffered out of proportion in all
               this as it is the middle-class – the professionals, the people living on incomes, the
               gently bred. Laborers are organized and can force their needs on the attention of
               employers, for labor is always in demand and labor has managed to get paid. But the
               arts, the luxuries, the refinements of life are dispensed with at such times I know
               that the families of even physicians go hungering to-day. And this class of people
               have not the hardihood to take up cobblestones and help themselves. But among the
               desperately poor and others there has come a new point of view in morality or
               unmorality. You hear people saying. ›Since it is permitted to steal!–‹«</p>
            <p>He finished with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>
            <p>I thought of something I had seen that afternoon. Down one of the main streets of <rs
                  type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> a cart full of coal drove slowly. Behind it
               walked a man in a soldier’s faded uniform; to guard the coal I thought. Then as the
               wagon came abreast me I saw that he was calmly picking out big lumps of coal from the
               wagon and putting them in a sack. If faces mean anything that man was habitually
               honest. Nor was there the least sign of guilt or fear in his manner. Having filled
               his sack he gave it to his comrade, another soldier who had been walking near him,
               and taking from him another sack proceeded to fill that, too. Nobody seemed to notice
               the proceeding nor to think anything about it if they did notice it.</p>

               </rs>, »is common in <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> to-day, but not
               characteristic of it. It simply means that its spirit is submerged.«</p>
            <p>»Crushed?« I asked.</p>
            <p>»The spirit of <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> can never be crushed,« he said
               with rising enthusiasm. »There is still too much of youth in it left. Relieve a
               little of the load on it and you will see it rise. But it needs a strong friend to
               help it up. It needs a country like <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> to take
               it by the hand. And well it would repay any such assistance. It would repay with
               talent of every kind. With high intelligence in industry. With a lovingness of
               nature. With enthusiasms in work in which it is interested. With music and
               lithographic art; with modern science and with a sure taste of beauty; with
               machinery, surgery, decoration, music, architecture – all that a great modern city
               can give to the world; a city indomitably young in spirit, matured by great
               experiences, tempered by fire and made wiser by suffering. The <rs type="place"
                  ref="#50">Vienna</rs> of the merely gay days, the days of thoughtless youth, is
               gone. But it lies in the hands of the Allies whether in its place there develops a
               new <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> which, instead of being a burden to the
               world and to itself, becomes one of the great and beautiful cities of
               civilization.«</p>
