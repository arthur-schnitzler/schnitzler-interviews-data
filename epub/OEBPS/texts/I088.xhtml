                  him – as a man, a writer and a Jew. – The Editor.</span></p>
            
            <p>At the beginning of the twentieth century Arthur Schnitzler’s most famous writings
               were his »Anatol,« »Liebelei,« »Sterben,« »Leutenant Gustl.« A light sort of writing,
               in form and in content. Dialogues: between people of elegant manners and wellmanicured
               ideas; between graceful and polite sentimentalists; between people disappointed in
               love but still hunting for the supreme thrill: between intellectual esthetes unfit
               for the hardships of life, with too soft hands and backbones; between women who avidly
               seek the perfect lover and try to escape the everyday drabness of their prosaic existence.
               And above the tribulations and often petty tragedies of Schnitzler’s puppets there
               always hung the cloud of inevitable death, which whipped them into life and yet, at
               the same time, paralyzed them. The thought of the end, which made them realize the
               futility of love and yet drove them on to find that elusive something which might
               cheat the Grim Reaper of his victim. This is the essence of Schnitzler’s first literary
               decade. But to that should be added a fine, skeptical, often ironic smile, the smile
               of Arthur Schnitzler who, instead of pitying his contemporaries, just looks at them
               sadly as they struggle against their fate. A smile that makes us weep.</p>
            
            <p>I still remember my surprise when I met Arthur Schnitzler for the first time at Vienna,
               in <span class="date">September, 1903</span>. I had expected to find a snob, an elegant idler, a middle-aged »Anatol.« His reputation
               – conceptions of authors by readers are mostly misleading – was that of a polished,
               brilliant and rather superficial literateur in his personal life. But the Schnitzler
               I met, then in his forties, impressed me much more as a scholar than as a novelist
               in vogue. His medical training – Schnitzler is a graduate physician and for some years
               was attached to a Vienna hospital – had influenced him strongly. His interest in <a id="T_I088-1"><!--anchor--></a>psychology<span class="note" id="T_I088-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘psychoolgy’</span></span> was that of a man of science. When he spoke of people and of sociological currents
               it was in the language of a sober observer, a studious research worker and a pitiless
               prober. It had been his lot, as a physician, to handle a human species naked, without
               official garb, without the distinction of rank. He had found himself almost in the
               role of a spiritual and physical father confessor. During our conversation, on my
               first visit to him, we spoke primarily of the Jewish renaissance movement and the
               awakening of the Jewish national consciousness. He modestly assumed the role of the
               listener eager to be informed. There were moments when he struck me as pedantic, rather
               too serious, almost solemn.</p>
            
            <p>In later years, at subsequent meetings, my first impressions were merely confirmed
               Arthur Schnitzler the man was the very antithesis of the dandy the intelligentsia
               of Europe visualized him. It was the old trap into which readers fall so readily –
               that of shaping the author in accordance with the personages or heroes of his works
               – which was responsible for the distorted legend that had been created around Arthur
               Schnitzler the Viennese author.</p>
            
            <p>You will ask me: »But to what extent is Arthur Schnitzler a Jew?« If you will forgive
               me – the question is rather unnecessary and petty. Jewishness cannot be measured in
               doses or percentages. And surely not when it comes to a personality like Arthur Schnitzler,
               with so distinct an outlook upon life. Born at Vienna, of what we are wont to call
               an assimilated family – his father was a distinguished physician and a Professor at
               the University of Vienna – Arthur Schnitzler although he personally did not experience
               any virulent anti-Semitism, clearly recognized the anomalous position of the Austrian
               Jew. He pondered on the Jewish question long and sincerely. He gathered material laboriously.
               When, <a id="K_I088-12"><!--anchor--></a>a year before the world war<span class="note" id="K_I088-12h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Die Uraufführung fand am <a class="link_ref"></a> statt.</span>, he published »Professor Bernhardi,« a play centering around a medical Dreyfus case
               and exposing the anti-Semitic tendencies in Vienna’s medical and government circles,
               he stamped himself as a foe of the assimilationist movement.</p>
            
            <p>But the story of Professor Bernhardi is told with an ironic smile. No attempt is made
               to effect a reform; nor is the author inclined to let his indignation get the best
               of him. The last word before the curtain goes down is characteristic of Schnitzler.
               Somehow it leaves you doubtful as to whether Professor Bernhardi, who was condemned
               to two months in jail because he forbade a priest to give absolution to a patient,
               was an idealist or merely a fool. None the less the play created a furore and showed
               clearly where Schnitzler stood with regard to his Jewishness. No more ruthless caricature
               of the assimilated and converted Jew has been written than Schnitzler’s »Professor
               Bernhardi.«</p>
            
            <p>Thus Schnitzler is inscribed in the German literary Who’s Who as a Jewish author,
               although – except in »Professor Bernhardi« and his novel »Der Weg Ins Freie« – he
               has not concerned himself with Jewish questions. He was satisfied to write of the
               Viennese, of the sentimental, romantic loves of half-baked girls, of elegant officers,
               of disillusioned servant girls, derailed doctors. After the war, it is true, he gave
               us »Casanova’s Homecoming,« a pseudo-historical novel in which he reveals himself
               at the very acme of his creative talent and which constitutes one of his rare excursions
               outside of Vienna.</p>
            
            <p>One cannot even attempt to condense so prolific an author and so genuine a personality
               as Schnitzler into the framework of an article. In contemporary literature Arthur
               Schnitzler is considered one of the great trio of which Gerhardt Hauptmann and Thomas
               Mann are the other members. This despite the subject-matter of his works, which, as
               already mentioned, deal with rather superficial joys of life. For the critical reader,
               however, there are always two stories in any Schnitzler book: One that plays in the
               foreground and is of apparently only local interest and skin-deep significance: but
               in the background, if one cares to delve deeper into Schnitzler’s stories, there is
               enacted the eternal human tragedy of man in search of love, in fear of death and in
               a fruitless struggle to liberate himself from the material and sensual world.</p>
            
            <p>It is on this second plane that Arthur Schnitzler reminds one of Anatole France –
               a skeptic to whom nothing human is foreign, an observer who finds the eternal problems
               in the everyday life of a harlot or a soldier just as tragic as the tribulations of
               a statesman or an artist.</p>
            
            <p>As Schnitzler enters his seventieth year – a commanding figure who has managed to
               keep himself above all the petty political gibbering of Europe, whose creative output
               has always been marked by an artistocratic distinction that made it possible for him
               to say and discuss everything without ever becoming vulgar – he represents the genuine
               artist. There is nothing of the professional man of letters in him. No jealousies,
               no best-seller attitude to literature. He hates, and always has hated, the literary
               charlatan who strives for effect and hastens to catch the latest literary vogue or
               school, hoping by means of his ability to be up-to-date to squeeze through the narrow
               gate of immortality. Schnitzler’s books may not live much longer than the first half
               of the twentieth century – but to us, his contemporaries, he is a vital, nay, inspiring
               personality and author.</p>
