            <p>You look at this city and regretfully wonder. Was there ever a Vienna of the Strauss
               waltzes? Of delectable cafés rivalling Paris, whose coffee and rosette-like rolls
               of white flour sent the name Vienna around the world? Were these boulevards ever gay
               at night with lights and music from every restaurant? Where is the bright-faced populace
               that flocked on Sundays to Wiener Wald at the first excuse for Spring? Is Kreisler’s
               »Caprice Viennoise« mere fancy? And when you have studied the faces in the city of
               to-day you wonder most of all, was there ever a Vienna such as Dr. Arthur Schnitzler,
               physician, novelist and playwright, pictured in his »Anatol« – the Anatol of lighthearted
               loves and delicate sorrows, to whom every day was new with hope, and who elevated
               the embarrassments of partings with the old loves to such a graceful art?</p>
            <p>Yet that Vienna must have existed once upon a time, lived and played with life and
               fashioned a city to its moods. For, although »Anatol« made its bow to the world over
               thirty years ago, it still lives even to the English reading public in Granville Barker’s
               exquisite <a id="KT156-2"><!--anchor--></a>version<span class="note" id="KT156-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><a id="gollombKuba"><!--anchor--></a> <span class="bibl">Anatol: A Sequence of Dialogues by Arthur Schnitzler; Paraphrased for the English

Since there is no Ibsen-like freight of social significance in these little
               comedies, what has kept them alive so long?</p>
            <p>If, as it must be, there is in them the salt of truth, that Anatol once really lived,
               and with him his city, then it is a much changed Vienna to-day. The Ring, that girdle
               of boulevards that encircles the heart of the city, is still handsome in its way,
               ponderous with palaces and public buildings, and is still immaculately clean. In their
               regal days their architecture was less expressive of Vienna than of a royalty that
               imitated Prussia. But now that these palaces are awkward with soup kitchens and offices,
               and somewhat shabby for lack of paint and repairs, palaces and people are more akin
               in mood. The outward aspect of the world you see on the Ring during the day – at night
               there are few people and fewer lights – shows no remarkable poverty, although beggars
               are plentiful and startlingly theatrical. But it is only the outward aspect of the
               city you see on the Ring – the employed, and those who don’t have to work, and foreigners.
               The real Vienna of to-day has little heart for the boulevards; and in the back reaches
               of the city there is starvation.</p>
            <p>However, since Viennese <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> <span class="italics">must</span> have cafés, you see them crowded. On the tables there is plenty of drinking water,
               a little weak chocolate, spiritless beer, occasionally coffee, more often a substitute,
               and little or no sugar or milk. For those who can afford it a single sardine on a
               plate – two is a double portion – with a dab of mustard if you are willing to pay
               for it. Of bread, even the darkish mongrel kind, there is none, unless you are dining
               in some haunt of profiteers. The people sit beside these nominal excuses for refreshments,
               looking a little conscious of their worn clothes, for Viennese know what it is to
               dress well. They glance through skimpy journals; paper costs enormously. They comment
               occasionally on this or that, and are mildly glad when the music strikes up.</p>
            <p>In the biggest cafés there is music; for musicians, like other professionals in Vienna,
               are plentiful and to be had cheaply. I know of a leather goods buyer from America
               who hired a quintet from a symphony orchestra to play for him a whole evening in his
               hotel room. With tips they cost him two and a half dollars, so low is the Austrian
               krone. In the café you can have an excellent sketch in crayon made of yourself for
               twenty cents; thirty for a caricature by a man who will show you his work in the humorous
               weekly you are reading. The orchestra plays superbly and the applause is generous.
               But it all sounds hollow. Something is not there. A Strauss-like waltz you seldom
               hear. For Vienna, like the rest of Europe, has turned to the popular music of America;
               America, the young and vital when Europe is so tired; America so overflowing with
               barbaric vitality that the jazz band is its expression. Tunes that ran their brief
               course in the United States two and three years ago bring real hand-clapping from
               the Viennese to-day; and somehow even to an American they seem to have a surprising
               freshness and youth here.</p>
            <p>On Sundays the people still flock to Wiener Wald. But it is only to gather wood. The
               splendid forests, once the pride of the Viennese and loved for their green beauties,
               are being cut down for fuel; and you see people dragging logs of new wood for miles
               back to the city. Recently the park department ordered a general pruning of trees
               in the city, just to give the poor a chance to gather the twigs that fell.</p>
            <p>And as to the world of Anatol and his friends?</p>
            <p>I went to Dr. Schnitzler himself for news of them. The man who has caught the spirit
               of Vienna’s youth is numerically fifty-seven years old. He is rather square in build
               and therefore looks shorter than he is; but an aliveness that would mean youth at
               any age gives him dominance in any group. His gray-blue eyes are warm and bright.
               His ample brown hair and trimmed beard give no hint of his years in spite of the gray
               in them. He talks fast, well and buoyantly, constantly crowded from his theme by a
               swarm of shouldering memories. Goethe, Schiller, Lessing, Heine, George Bernard Shaw
               and Shakespeare, the last two in German as well as in English, and a host of other
               books look down from the shelves of handsome book cabinets. Through a panelled window
               I saw a glimpse of woods with a red sun setting behind the trees; in the other direction,
               down hill, the roofs of Vienna itself. A white porcelain stove in a corner; dark rosewood
               furniture; a bowl of brilliant geraniums; framed prints on the wall, all took the
               warm twilight comfortably, endearingly.</p>
            <p>»The Vienna of ›Anatol‹ lived in the late <span class="date">’80</span>’s,« Dr. Schnitzler said, answering my query. »It belonged to a time of economic ease
               and freedom from the weight of social problems clamoring for solution, a time when
               charming young idlers could bloom and thrive. It was largely then that the lighthearted,
               tuneful, gracefully living Vienna of the foreigner’s imagination was nearest reality.
               You mention Strauss waltzes. Strauss’s music is only a waft of melody through a partly
               opened door. It happened that his compositions found favor in the world outside. Vienna
               had other waltz music besides Strauss. Its mood was the mood of a sunny day in the
               spring, Sunday. Of course, there was the workaday world for the mass of Viennese.
               But it was not a grinding week in the main. Employment was not very scarce and good
               food and good light wines and beer not dear. And then, too, as soon as winter let<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e380">[Page]</span> up there was Wiener Wald to go to and play. The Viennese are a most lovable people
               when the sun smiles. They have a veritable talent for laughing, for melody, for art,
               for the graces of life. When the sun smiles –« Dr. Schnitzler repeated.</p>
            <p>»But one of the most characteristic traits of the Viennese is changeableness of mood,«
               he continued. »And the modern world did not leave them free for long, free of the
               cares of maturity. From every side problems closed in on them – social, political,
               economic, racial problems which are breaking down sterner peoples than the Austrians.
               And the youthful Vienna of ›Anatol’s‹ day soon vanished like a dream. Long before
               the Great War came that Vienna became a changed world. Possibly it is because I am
               much older that I see things differently. But I know many young men to-day. And it
               seems to me that the present generation is much different from that of ›Anatol’s‹
               day. It is made of sterner, solider stuff. It has been tempered by fire and hammered
               on the anvil of economic life. Our young men since the <span class="date">80’s</span> have had to choose sides and fight in many a war. I don’t mean national wars only.
               They are easier for youth to weather. You go with the rest, <a id="K_I070-1"><!--anchor--></a>that’s all<span class="note" id="K_I070-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Der Erstdruck ohne Verfasserangabe vom <span class="date">9. 5. 1920</span> endet hier. Da der zweite Abdruck deutlich länger ist, wird dieser für die Wiedergabe
                  verwendet.</span>. But when it is a case of war between clericalism against agnosticism and atheism,
               capitalism against socialism, militarism against its antagonists – why, then the battleground
               is often in the heart and mind and family of the young fellow himself. It is no longer
               a question of yielding to contagion. It becomes a matter of heart searching, bitter
               conflict in the home, in the workshop, in the circle of friends where formerly you
               found only the problem of what to play. Strikes and election campaigns, mass demonstrations
               and repression, military abuse and the hatreds they bred – these were the matters
               that soon took up the time and thoughts and emotions of our young people. Oh, they
               kept on playing, too, of course. They will never stop playing. That is in the bone
               and blood of the Viennese. But they no longer played with life.</p>
            <p>»You see, the city itself developed like a too fast growing child. In <span class="date">1850</span> it was a comparatively small affair surrounded by a fortress. The Ring, which is
               now the main artery of the city, was then only country, a free place, a road. Why,
               as late as <span class="date">1890</span> <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> Mariahilferstrasse was a suburb. To-day it is one of the busiest of Vienna’s business
               streets. The city grew too fast for its small clothes. New demands were made on hearts
               too young to meet them. The result was worry, confusion, the punishments of life on
               all mistakes of immaturity. From much of this Vienna has recovered. But it has not
               recovered its unthinking youth, its untroubled gayety.</p>
            <p>»You must remember that to begin with Vienna was not quite so light as the world imagines
               it.« Dr. Schnitzler had constantly to retrace his characterizations. It was interesting
               to see in him the impulse to sketch a character or a situation with a striking figure
               of speech, and to see that impulse overtaken, checked and corrected by the equally
               strong passion to present the same subject in all its fullness and complexity. »Along
               with Strauss waltzes Vienna has produced steel and surgery and contributions to the
               science of criminology and many other things the world would expect of our neighbors,
               the Germans. We are always being compared to the Germans, or contrasted rather. Of
               course there is quite a striking difference, but not between us and the Germans as
               a whole as between us and Prussia. Our immediate neighbors, the Germans of the south,
               of course blend in with our character.</p>
            <p>»In one respect Vienna has had a hard time growing up. It finds it hard to take itself
               or others seriously, particularly itself. North Germany, for example, has always found
               Vienna amusing. Well, our people took that as their cue too. It became the fashion
               for our correspondents to foreign newspapers to poke fun at everything Viennese. The
               result was that no native talent was prophetic among our people. Now there is a great
               deal of fine talent among them. But it has a hard time getting itself appreciated
               here – until it has received approval abroad. Gustave Mahler found it so; hundreds
               of others have had the same experience. Look at this, for example!«</p>
            <p>He took up from the desk a sketch in sepia crayon of a young woman’s relaxed body.
               It seemed to me an astounding achievement. It was a matter of lines of crayon on paper.
               But they did not seem immobile. Almost I looked for those lines to move lazily, flexing
               and turning with the half asleep comfort of that young person.</p>
            <p>»It’s the work of a <a id="KT156-5"><!--anchor--></a> young artist <span class="note" id="KT156-5h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>nicht identifiziert; es könnte sich, wenn man einen gröberen Irrtum des Interviewers
                  annimmt, um eines der beiden Zeichnungen von Gustav Klimt in Schnitzlers Besitz handeln
                  (<span class="bibl"><span class="titlem">A. S. und die bildende Kunst</span>, S. 127</span>).</span> of the first order,« he went on enthusiastically. »Yet Vienna has not opened its
               eyes to him; and will not. I suppose, until he returns a foreign celebrity. And this
               disinclination of our people to recognize the intrinsic worth of its own talent has
               a positive fault. Viennese are prone to accept the shoddy products – not in art, for
               their taste is sure in that respect, but of demagogues who lay themselves out to capture
               popularity. We had a <a id="KT156-4"><!--anchor--></a> burgomaster <span class="note" id="KT156-4h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Karl Lueger, Bürgermeister von <span class="date">1897</span> bis <span class="date">1910</span></span> not so long ago who was a genius in his way. He knew exactly the degree of folly
               in the Viennese mind and how to cater to it. As a result his popularity was so tremendous
               that Emperor Franz Joseph himself was jealous of the huzzahs which greeted this burgomaster
               every time he stirred out of his house. He got it all by such utterances as this:
               ›<a id="KT156-3"><!--anchor--></a>Nature knows best. If I were dangerously ill I would follow the advice of a superstitious
               wife rather than that of the wisest doctor!<span class="note" id="KT156-3h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Es könnte sich um eine Aussage handeln, die Lueger im niederösterreichischen Landtag
                  getätigt hat, jedenfalls hat er sich bei einer Debatte um die Gebührenordnung in den
                  Krankenanstalten gegen »neue Medikamente« ausgesprochen, die nur teurer sind und Patienten
                  krank halten sollen. »<span class="quote">‘Früher hat man den gewissen Hausmitteln eine viel grössere Beachtung geschenkt, und
                     ich scheue mich nicht, offen zu bekennen, dass ich, wenn ich vor die Wahl gestellt
                     werde, eines der neueren Mittel oder ein altes Hausmittel zu gebrauchen, zu dem alten
                     Hausmittel greife, welches erstens billiger ist und zweitens viel gesünder’</span>« (<span class="bibl">Zeitschrift des allgemeinen österreichischen Apotheker-Vereines, Jg. 33, Nr. 2, <span class="date">10. 1. 1895</span>, S. 44</span>).</span>‹ That’s one aspect of Vienna. Another is the great number of bookstores.«</p>
            <p>That was one of the things which struck me most forcibly about Vienna. Food is scarce;
               paper costs appallingly; rags are almost precious; and yet the bookstores about the
               city are many and opulent in stock. And the beauty and color of lithography, the unstinted
               quality and quantity of material and the briskness of the business are astonishing.</p>
            <p>»There you have it,« Dr. Schnitzler commented when I spoke of it. »On the one hand,
               a readiness to accept the shoddy demagogue; on the other hand, a keen desire for the
               best in thought and art. Reluctance to accept a prophet of their own people and the
               quick appreciation of the talent and genius of other lands. I suppose Vienna is adolescent
               still; its character is not yet formed; its inconsistencies still lie side by side,
               intact and unmodified. Or rather I should say that was the condition of affairs with
               us in <span class="date">1914</span>. Since then there have been fiery years, years in which the character of Vienna has
               aged many times six years</p>
            <p>»The Crown Prince, Franz Ferdinand, was not very much liked in Vienna,« Dr. Schnitzler
               went on, his tone changing unconsciously as he came to the war. »But his murder produced
               a genuine shock. Before Vienna could recover from it and to think clearly events came
               rushing like a mountainslide. Of course they were largely manipulated; and still more
               they had their momentum in great economic and political movements of hostility over
               which not only Vienna had no control, but even the rulers of the world.</p>
            <p>»I feel that our people have no love for militarism and that, left to themselves,
               they would have sought a solution less savage than war; but events and institutions
               dragooned them into it and Austria was one of the very first countries to feel the
               shock of war. In <span class="date">September</span> and <span class="date">November of 1914</span> the <a id="K_I070-77"><!--anchor--></a>Russian armies swept into Austria like a tidal wave<span class="note" id="K_I070-77h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>In den ersten Monate des Krieges wurde die österreichisch-ungarische Armee an der
                  Ostfront stark bedroht und musste sich auch mehrmals zurückziehen. Tatsächlich in

               To fly or not? Some people, notably the very rich – their very wealth seems to breed
               a cowardice – did fly in their autos. But in the main Vienna stayed. Some out of pride;
               others because of fatalism; many because leaving Vienna would be a discomfort and
               a strangeness worse than any evil they could picture of occupation by a foreign foe.</p>
            <p>»The Russians did not come to Vienna, but a terrible measure of war came to the Viennese.
               Every engagement in the field sent us back a flood of dead and wounded. Those who
               had stayed behind to work staggered under unremitting overwhelming burdens. But of
               actual physical want in the city there was little until <span class="date">1915</span>, when bread cards were first given out. Even then the prices did not rise badly.
               So that while our people had superimposed them the weight of war, they still had their
               old Vienna to help them forget a little.</p>
            <p>»Then in <span class="date">1917</span> <span style="display:inline-block" width="1em"> </span> Vienna began to lose its lights. That was bad. Theatres began to close early. Even
               to-day performances must close at eight. And Vienna without its lights at night and
               without a good long evening at the theatre is not itself. Worse still was the early
               closing hour for our street railways. Our people are tremendously social, gregarious.
               Send them to bed early and you make them suffer, as the young always suffer when they
               are sent to bed early. Then on top of that came the endless mounting of carfare, until
               to-day it costs something like many times what it used to cost. Our people can no
               longer afford to visit their friends at any distance, to go to theatres, to cafés.</p>
            <p>»Deprived of their familiar escape, from the crushing realities of life the Viennese
               became a changed people – confused, heavy, spiritless, pondering. A new and terrible
               experience crept in on them – hunger. One after another food stocks of every kind
               became exhausted; on the other hand, prices went soaring so high that thinking in
               terms of money took on a kind of craziness. The familiar world assumed fantastic proportions.
               One saw everywhere the giddiness that comes of slow starvation. Great events came
               to mean little; a crust of bread, a broken shoe, a spell of freezing weather, everything.
               Even the end of fighting in the field brought no actual relief. Food stock still went
               on sinking; prices soared still higher. The Austrian krone could buy almost nothing
               from abroad. The foreigner came and bought everything in Austria for practically nothing
               – and at his coming prices leaped up and up.</p>
            <p>»It became a tremendously profitable thing to smuggle in food from the country and
               to sell it at illegal rates to the foreigner and the profiteer. The farmer who had
               food kept it from the open market for the <span class="italics">schleichhändler</span>, who paid him exorbitant prices and still made a huge profit. Our people saw their
               own children starving. And in the big hotels and restaurants, on the Ring and before
               the Opera House, they saw overfed, bejewelled, fur-clad <span class="italics">schiebers</span> (profiteers) and <span class="italics">schleichhändler</span> rolling in opulence. It made our people exceedingly bitter.«</p>
            <p>»How is it they don’t take stones and smash in the windows of hotels and restaurants
               and help themselves?« I asked.</p>
            <p>»Well, for one thing, the Viennese is not the explosive kind. Physical violence is
               rather repulsive to him. Another reason, however, is that it is not the proletariat
               who have suffered out of proportion in all this as it is the middle-class – the professionals,
               the people living on incomes, the gently bred. Laborers are organized and can force
               their needs on the attention of employers, for labor is always in demand and labor
               has managed to get paid. But the arts, the luxuries, the refinements of life are dispensed
               with at such times I know that the families of even physicians go hungering to-day.
               And this class of people have not the hardihood to take up cobblestones and help themselves.
               But among the desperately poor and others there has come a new point of view in morality
               or unmorality. You hear people saying. ›Since it is permitted to steal!–‹«</p>
            <p>He finished with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>
            <p>I thought of something I had seen that afternoon. Down one of the main streets of
               Vienna a cart full of coal drove slowly. Behind it walked a man in a soldier’s faded
               uniform; to guard the coal I thought. Then as the wagon came abreast me I saw that
               he was calmly picking out big lumps of coal from the wagon and putting them in a sack.
               If faces mean anything that man was habitually honest. Nor was there the least sign
               of guilt or fear in his manner. Having filled his sack he gave it to his comrade,
               another soldier who had been walking near him, and taking from him another sack proceeded
               to fill that, too. Nobody seemed to notice the proceeding nor to think anything about
               it if they did notice it.</p>
            <p>»That,« commented Dr. Schnitzler, »is common in Vienna to-day, but not characteristic
               of it. It simply means that its spirit is submerged.«</p>
            <p>»Crushed?« I asked.</p>
            <p>»The spirit of Vienna can never be crushed,« he said with rising enthusiasm. »There
               is still too much of youth in it left. Relieve a little of the load on it and you
               will see it rise. But it needs a strong friend to help it up. It needs a country like
               America to take it by the hand. And well it would repay any such assistance. It would
               repay with talent of every kind. With high intelligence in industry. With a lovingness
               of nature. With enthusiasms in work in which it is interested. With music and lithographic
               art; with modern science and with a sure taste of beauty; with machinery, surgery,
               decoration, music, architecture – all that a great modern city can give to the world;
               a city indomitably young in spirit, matured by great experiences, tempered by fire
               and made wiser by suffering. The Vienna of the merely gay days, the days of thoughtless
               youth, is gone. But it lies in the hands of the Allies whether in its place there
               develops a new Vienna which, instead of being a burden to the world and to itself,
               becomes one of the great and beautiful cities of civilization.«</p>
