               has been written in books and elsewhere about the play, but the author has remained
               more or less of a mythical figure. (It is worthy of note that another piece by Dr.

               <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur Schnitzler</rs> is somewhat of a legendary

            <p>
               <rs type="person" ref="#10863">Richard Beer-Hoffmann</rs>, a major poet in the German
               language and father of the present director of »<rs type="work" ref="#29935"
                  >Anatol</rs>,« is a neighbor of Dr. <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur
                  Schnitzler</rs>, living in the outskirts of <rs type="place" ref="#50"
               >Vienna</rs>. One day when I was taking tea with the <rs type="person" ref="#10863"
                  >Beer-Hoffmanns</rs> I was asked if I had met <rs type="person" ref="#2121"
                  >Schnitzler</rs>. I said »No,« but I would like to meet him, although I had been
               told generally that that was impossible. Herr <rs type="person" ref="#10863"
                  >Beer-Hoffmann</rs> assured me that it was not difficult at all. He went to the
               telephone and called up the doctor. A ten-minute talk followed and he returned saying
               he was sorry, but Dr. <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> was averse to
               meeting strangers.</p>
            <p>A few weeks later I told this anecdote to the late <rs type="person" ref="#11740"
                  >Hugo von <anchor type="textConst" xml:id="T_I085-8"/>Hofmannsthal<note

               (writer of the scores of many of <rs type="person" ref="#12870">Richard Strauss</rs>’
               famous operas), also an intimate of <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>. He
               sat down and wrote a letter to him and arranged to make an appointment for me by
               telephone after the letter had been received. This led to an appointment to see <rs
                  type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> that was broken three times, as though
               he repented of it, before I was finally invited to come positively.</p>
            <p>Through a most regrettable circumstance I mislaid the precious address – that does

                  type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> menage. Every one else informed me that
               he had heard the name somewhere, he thought, but had no idea where this person lived.
               I arrived nearly an hour later than the appointed time.</p>
            <head type="sub">Awaited Author in Fear</head>
            <p>Dismayed and with fear and trembling, I followed the <anchor type="commentary"

               upstairs. I wondered just what was going to happen to me for thus practically
               insulting a great man by keeping him waiting an hour for an appointment he had never
               wanted to make. I sat there in his Biedermayer parlor conjuring up visions of this
               creator of so many heroes of wild escapades and heroines of so many pitiful tragedies
               and of the famous Wiener »Suesse Madl.« I thought of »<rs type="work" ref="#42883">
                  <anchor type="textConst" xml:id="T_T030171-1"/>Casanova<note type="textConst"

               of »<rs type="work" ref="#32808">The Affairs of Anatol</rs>« and at once conceived a
               daredevil swaggering sort of adventure. I remembered now that I had seen <rs
                  type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>’s photograph once with a long pointed
               beard that somehow gave me the impression that he would be a tall man and slender,
               with twinkling eyes.</p>
            <p>Then he entered the room – or rather, he peeped in first and then tip-toed in, half
               fearfully it seemed. He was nothing I imagined him to be. I was wrong in everything
               but the beard. He was shortish and a bit <anchor type="commentary" xml:id="K_I085-5"

                  rundlich</note> in figure, a little hunched. His clothes were no more stylish than
               his manner was dashing. His coat was too amply cut and he was gemuetlich, which means
               »graciously friendly,« if it can be translated at all. He was gentle, sweet-natured
               and every remark he made was characterized by charity, or hastily revised for fear
               that I would think he was calling things or people names. And above all, he seemed
               more scared than I was. The task before me seemed one of assuring him that there was
               nothing to be scared about, and I set about it by abjectly apologizing for my being
               so unpardonably late and explaining how it came about.</p>
            <p>
               <ref type="question" target="#q013"/>»I write many things at once,« he was soon
               telling me, one moment as solemn as an owl, the next with a twinkle in his eyes that
               never quite approached merriment. He showed me a little room in which he sometimes
               worked, although for the most part he wrote standing up before a little oldfashioned
               slant desk that stood before a broad bay window looking out into his gardens, from
               which he seemed to derive no end of inspiration both from working in them and looking
               down upon them.</p>
            <p>I asked him to explain how he could write more than one thing at a time.</p>
            <head type="sub">Writes Play and Novel Together</head>
            <p>»I like to write a play and a novel at the same time. By that I mean when I am tired
               of writing one I turn to the other and find it refreshing. The styles of writing the
               two are so very different. I find fiction is more confining and I feel the dead
               weight of it after I have been writing steadily for some time; whereas playwriting is
               always exciting and I pause when it has exhausted me by carrying me breathlessly or
               passionately to some <anchor type="textConst" xml:id="T_I085-5"/>denouement<note
                  type="textConst" xml:id="T_I085-5h"><quote>denounement</quote></note>. I play
               one off against the other and find that many problems that seemed impossible
               yesterday come with less difficulty when I turn back to them after a day’s exercise
               in a quite different field of creation. My last two books and a play I wrote in this
               manner – all at once, so to speak. And I finished them all at one time nearly.</p>
            <p>»My critics sometimes say that I am always concerned in some way with the virtue of
               women. I suppose that is true, since I find that most of the passionately dramatic
               things of life – especially its tragedies – are concerned with the virtue – or lack
               of it – of women. There are some who say that the virtue of women has altered since
               the war. But I do not think so. The change is really not so great as we read. People
               are much the same; surely human nature has not altered. The human boundaries only are
               changed – more freedom is given to go out, which, alas, has its corollary, implying
               there is more freedom to invade the private life and person. There are chain and
               penalties of freedom as well as of imprisonment.</p>
            <p>»The great thing is that women in ever increasing numbers are no longer in the home,
               but are out working, and that I find in itself is a very excellent change. If it
               gives the woman freedom it also equips her with independence. She earns her own money
               and can choose her own friends, lovers if she will, like a man. Of course there is
               always danger of her losing the indispensable qualities of womanhood.«</p>
            <p>Between the lines and words, we may discern <rs type="person" ref="#2121"
                  >Schnitzler</rs>’s attitude toward »<rs type="work" ref="#32808">The Affairs of
                  Anatol</rs>.« Written in those days of gay <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs>,
               before the war, any romantic adventures were possible – nay, probable, according to
                  <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>. Only <rs type="person" ref="#2121"
                  >Schnitzler</rs> would have dared to write and try to produce the most audacious
               play of its period – »<rs type="work" ref="#29855">Reigen</rs>« – that was variously
               acclaimed and mobbed – even in liberal <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> – and
               finally proscribed even in the printing. The gloomiest tragedy stalks through his
               mind rubbing elbows or wings with oafish comedy and elfish fantasy. Always tinged and
               pierced with the flaming spear of virtue.</p>

                  hatte <rs type="person" ref="#22829">Erich Posselt</rs> angefertigt.</note> at the
               time. His novels were all being published regularly in English and his plays were

            <p>For one thing it takes too long on the water. I would like to go to <rs type="place"
                  ref="#175">America</rs>, perhaps, as a private man and make a journey through the
               country for pleasure – not to lecture. I would like to see little of <rs type="place"
                  ref="#44053">New York</rs>, but much of the country. But I am afraid they would
               not let me have my way and do these things. They invite me to come and write films!«
               He shrugged his shoulders expressively. »I much prefer to send them by post.</p>
            <p>»And then I am afraid of critics, all critics, people who write about me. I am afraid
               of you. At some time they suddenly say the wrong thing. It already is too late. That
               dictum can never, never be corrected once it has appeared! If a critic knows me well,
               then he knows me too well to write about me. If he knows me but slightly, then how
               can he know enough to write intelligently about me?«</p>
            <p>»I hope some day the <rs type="org" ref="#44005">Theater Guild</rs> will give my ›<rs
                  type="work" ref="#30203">Bernhardi</rs>,‹ about which we have corresponded. And
               there is a new translation of my ›<rs type="work" ref="#29985">Lonely Way</rs>‹ that
               should be done in <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs>.</p>
            <p>»I know it will not be as in <rs type="place" ref="#34438">Russia</rs> where they
               steal the things of the foreign artist. For thirty years they have played my ›<rs
                  type="work" ref="#29823">Fairy Tale</rs>,‹ but I have not received a single kopek
               for it. Many years ago a Russian actor looked me up as the author of a famous play in
                  <rs type="place" ref="#34438">Russia</rs>. ›But it cannot be my play?‹ ›Oh, yes,‹
               he insisted. ›I have spent many days in the magnificent home bought by the producer
               from the proceeds.‹</p>
            <p>»If he would not send me money, at least he might have written me a few words saying
               how much he enjoyed the house my piece had given him!«</p>
