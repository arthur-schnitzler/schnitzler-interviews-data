               traits.</p>
            <p>»We must also realise that while the human mind may be improved by education the
               human soul cannot be improved – for it cannot be changed. We may, therefore, hope
               that human beings will some day become wiser, but they cannot become better. Human
               beings are born egotists. They do not love one another unselfishly – they hate one
               another.</p>
            <p>»All we may hope for is that the intellectual leaders may succeed in showing the
               people that they must stop wars because it would be best for them to have no wars –
               because they would benefit more from peace than from war.</p>
            <head type="sub">Practical Pacificism </head>
            <p>»Pacifism should not be sentimental. That is useless. Pacifists should not say that
               it is wrong to kill; that it is unethical to destroy human life; that it is immoral
               to commit such a crime; that other people suffer from such destruction, and that war
               is terrible on that account.</p>
            <p>»Everybody knows that war is terrible; that it leaves dead and maimed in its wake;
               that it destroys property, and retards what is known as civilization. But such
               methods of reasoning, such arguments are of no avail. Human beings are not impressed
               by them. Human beings do not change their nature on that account.</p>
            <p>»Instead of sentimental pacifism it is essential to convince them by education that
               peace would benefit them and save them – that in a roundabout way they themselves or
               their children may be the victims of war – the wounded, the mutilated, the dead.</p>
            <head type="sub">The Quality of Love</head>
            <p>»It is of very little value to preach love and the brotherhood of man, for it does
               not help. There are some people who believe that it is enough for them to preach or
               to listen to sermons on loving one’s neighbor as themselves – and that by this they
               have already discharged all their duties to their fellow-men.</p>
            <p>»The quality of unselfish love is not inherent in human beings – and it is useless to
               demand of human beings to change that which cannot be changed. Besides, it is not
               necessary at all. I do not want people to love me. I do not want their kisses. I
               don’t think it necessary that there should be too much love among the nations.</p>
            <p>»The important thing is that people should realize that they must not wrong one
               another – that they must not hurt or injure one another. The important thing is that
               people should have the opportunity to work, undisturbed, in peace; that they should
               not interfere with others; that they should not destroy others; that they should not
               rob others. They must learn to realise that war will affect them directly in some way
               or other just as they believe war would affect their enemy, their neighbor.</p>
            <head type="sub">Rejoicing in Death</head>
            <p>»Yesterday, while my <rs type="person" ref="#2238" subtype="implied">daughter</rs>
               was packing to go to the country, we found a batch of old newspapers published during
               the war. I looked at the headlines. ›The Battle of – .‹<space unit="chars"
                  quantity="1"/>›We Captured 50,000 men. Tens of Thousands Slain.‹ And the
               jubilation over each victory! I remember how our people rejoiced when they heard that
               thousands of <rs type="place" ref="#34438">Russians</rs> were drowned in swamps.</p>
            <p>»I was filled with terror as I recalled all this. Of course, the other side did
               exactly the same. They too, rejoiced when hundreds of thousands of our people were
               slaughtered. And I recalled with horror the indifference with which people afterwards
               read about those battles.</p>
            <p>»When, for instance, they read that fifty thousand men had been slain, and on the
               following morning the revised figures showed that instead of fifty thousand there
               really were sixty thousand casualties, did that difference disturb the people’s
               sleep, or did it affect their appetites? Not in the least. They went on eating,
               drinking and smoking their cigars.</p>
            <p>»In fact, the men at the front hated the ›enemy‹ less than the people in the rear –
               we know that at the front the men often fraternized with the ›enemy,‹ while the
               people in the rear hated the ›enemy‹ intensely – and this hate is continuing. And in
               certain places it is even encouraged deliberately – fanned and spread <anchor

                        actually be affected by such news much less than by the natural death of
                        someone on our block. If a fire breaks out in our neighbor’s house, we are
                        upset and worried to the extent that we fear lest the fire should spread to
                        our own house. If a fire breaks out somewhere in our city, we are worried
                        because it may destroy the house of one of our relatives or friends. If we

            <p>»I recall a simple, quite unimportant incident, but it is so characteristic that I
               will tell it to you. Some years ago my <rs type="person" subtype="implied"
                  ref="#2173">wife</rs> had scarlet fever. We had a <anchor type="commentary"

               <note type="commentary" xml:id="K_implied_27740h">nicht identifiziert. Die Erkrankung
                  bestand im <date>Dezember 1907</date>.</note> who attended her. The <rs
                  type="person" ref="#27740" subtype="implied">nurse</rs> was very correct, devoted,
               efficient and intelligent.</p>
            <p>»When my <rs type="person" ref="#2173" subtype="implied">wife</rs> recovered and the
                  <rs type="person" ref="#27740" subtype="implied">nurse</rs> was to leave, she had
               to wait about a quarter of an hour for an ambulance which was to fumigate her clothes
               in order that she may not infect other people.</p>
            <p>»When I went out of the house a few minutes later, I noticed to my great amazement
               that the <rs type="person" ref="#27740" subtype="implied">nurse</rs> entered a
               crowded street car, without having waited for the ambulance. She had no patience to
               wait fifteen minutes, and she went home by car without having taken the necessary
               precaution. She probably infected a number of people in that car with scarlet
               fever.</p>
            <p>»Here was a <rs type="person" ref="#27740" subtype="implied">nurse</rs> who knew well
               the dangers of such contagion. She was intelligent and it was her profession to look
               after patients, and be careful. But that did not matter to her. She went into the
               crowded street car because the passengers were just ordinary people whom she did not
               know. They were strangers to her, and she did not care.</p>
            <p>»But if, for instance, <rs type="person" ref="#27740" subtype="implied">she</rs> were
               to learn that someone was infected in that car by her, and that such person carried
               the disease to a child who happened to be a schoolmate of her own child, and in that
               way infected her own child – and her own child died as a result, of her recklessness
               and neglect, then she would think and act differently in the future.</p>
            <head type="sub">Benefits of Peace</head>
            <p>»Of course, if such a thing happened, people would say that it was an unusual case, a
               rare coincidence. But if people were to figure things out logically they would find
               that the wrong they do to others in some way or other necessarily reacts on
               themselves – they would understand that, and would stop wronging others. As I have
               said before, human beings may become wiser, but they will never grow better.</p>
            <p>»It is therefore the important task of intellectual leaders everywhere to organise
               themselves and start a campaign to enlighten the people that peace is in their own
               interests – that war will ruin them, while peace will <anchor type="commentary"
