                  folgenden einleitenden Worten: »<quote>
                     <rs type="person" ref="#2121">
                        <hi rend="capitals">Arthur Schnitzler</hi>
                     </rs>, perhaps best known to English readers through his ›<rs type="work"
                        ref="#29935">Anatol</rs>‹ cycle, ›<rs type="work" ref="#29923">The Road to
                        the Open</rs>,‹ ›<rs type="work" ref="#42883">Casanova’s Homecoming</rs>‹

                     <rs type="work" ref="#30201">Dr. Graesler</rs>,‹ stands in the forefront, not
                     only of Jewish creative artists, but of the creative artists of the world as
                     well. His faith, therefore, in the coming of a great Jewish artistic
                     renaissance is a faith which must give pride and hope to every member of the
                     Jewish community. <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur Schnitzler</rs> here
                     sets forth his views on Zionism, anti-Semitism and kindred subjects.</quote>«
                  und ein Porträt mit der Bildunterschrift: »<quote>
                     <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur Schnitzler</rs> / Playwright, Poet,
                     Philosopher / Physician and Psychologist</quote>«</note> strikes one as a man
               who needs all the force of his personality to keep his overwhelming brains quiet.
               That is the dominant impression I had <add place="above">of <rs type="person"
                     ref="#2121">Arthur Schnitzler</rs>
               </add> after twenty minutes of the most inspiring talk I have enjoyed with any man
               for <del rend="strikethrough">many</del> months.</p>
            <p>In a way this impression comes as a surprise. For there are in <rs type="person"
                  ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>’s writing certain qualities of suavity which like the
               outward reserve of a well mannered person, are only the outcome of good artistic
               breeding, but which to superficial people belie the real temperament both of the
               artist and the man. Even a sympathetic and imaginative study of <rs type="person"
                  ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>’s works will not always correct the error, and that is
               why I, as doubtless many others have done before me, came to him, expecting to find a
               personality cold, polished and courteous, a man of urbane scepticism, and gentle
               disillusionments, a temperamental agnostic, chastened of both anger and
               enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>Of course all these things are precisely, what Schnitzler is not. The first thing
               that strikes one about him is <subst>
                  <del rend="strikethrough">the</del>
                  <add place="inline">a</add>

                  </del>
                  <add place="inline">able</add>
               </subst> warmth and impetuousnes<add place="inline">s</add>. He is both mentally and
               physically a young man, despite his years. His eye is clear, his complexion rosy, and
               his grey hair and beard are shot with streaks of blond. In his mental attitude <rs
                  type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> is equally youthful. Whatever subject he
               touches, he is immediately on fire. His whole heart is in his talk, and he spends
               himself in it as recklessly as a boy of eighteen.<pb/>
            </p>
            <p>I found <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> in his little house in the
               suburbs of <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs>, in itself no mean achievement
               (finding him, I <anchor type="textConst" xml:id="T_I028-1"/>mean)<note

               <unclear>,</unclear> for <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> is one of the
               most sought after people in <rs type="place" ref="#468">Europe</rs> and has more or
               less to barricade himself against intruders. <rs type="person" ref="#2121"
                  >Schnitzler</rs> had broken off some dictation to come down to me, and had so to
               speak to rub his eyes a little before he could launch out on the new topic. Also he
               seemed at first disinclined to grant the interview.</p>
            <p>»I never give interviews,« he said. »All I have to say on the Jewish question is in
               my book ›<rs type="work" ref="#29923">Der Weg in’s Freie</rs>‹ I recommend – – –«</p>
            <p>»Herr Doctor,« I said, »I have not read <rs type="work" ref="#29923">Der Weg in’s
                  Freie</rs> once but three times and it is to discuss that book I have come to
               you.« An extraordinarily sweet smile broke out over Schnitzler’s face.</p>
            <p>»You are very flattering,« he said, and motioned me to a seat. And quite suddenly we
               were talking together<del rend="strikethrough"> at 90 miles an hour</del>.</p>
            <p>Talking to <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> is a delightful business.
               The same sense of grace and form that is so perceptible in his books, is evident in
               his talk and bearing, despite his vehemence and ready enthusiasm. He has among other
               things a perfect genius for letting himself be interrupted. If he sees you have
               something to say he waves you off so to speak for a couple of sentences, and then
               gives you a fraction of a second to leap into the talk. It is like an obliging bus
               driver slowing down between the official stopping places.<pb/>
            </p>
            <p>As one speaks to him, <subst>
                  <del rend="strikethrough">one</del>
                  <add place="above">and</add>
               </subst> becomes conscious of this terrific depth and intensity of feeling of the
               continous mental rush going on with<add place="inline">in</add> the man<add
                  place="inline">,</add> one forms some conception of the degree of unrelenting
               discipline it must cost <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> to have what he
               is namely one of the most polished and urbane writers in contemporary <rs
                  type="place" ref="#468">Europe</rs>. How easily that quick sensitivity, that
               overready response of the heart might have swamped his judgment and dimmed his taste!
               If <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> had not been <rs type="person"
                  ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>, he would one feels (not without a silent thanksgiving
               to Heaven for a calamity so nearly averted<add place="inline">)</add>, have made one
               of those prolific emotional writers, who despite the presence of real talent never
               rise higher than the second rank in in the artistic hierarchy. <anchor
                  type="commentary" xml:id="KT114-2"/>I remember thinking at the time that God hat
               originally intended <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> for a sort of <rs
                  type="person" ref="#5182">Upton Sinclair</rs>, and then at the last minute changed
               his mind.<note type="commentary" xml:id="KT114-2h">Dieser Satz durch eine Linie vom
                  Anfang des übernächsten Absatzes hierher bewegt.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is that there are two <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>s. There
               is the emotional Schnitzler with the irresistible creative urge in him, and there is
               his mentor warder and familiar spirit, the critical <rs type="person" ref="#2121"
                  >Schnitzler</rs>, and it is by a collaboration of the two separate individuals
               that <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>’s works come into being. This
               critical <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>, I don’t mind telling you, is
               the devil of a fellow. He is persistent wakeful and utterly unrelenting. Even in his
               own domain, having no other object for his <add place="inline">fury</add>, he turns
               and lacerates himself.</p>
            <p>»When I attempt any sort of critical or reflective writing,« said <rs type="person"
                  ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>, »I am half strangled by my own parentheses.«</p>
            <p>In other words <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> is one of those not
               altogether enviable<pb/>

               once it is aroused. Some object must be found for it, and it is therefore not
               unnaturally, that it concentrates on a section of the community that enjoys a certain
               traditional privilege of persecution, a section of the community<add place="inline"
