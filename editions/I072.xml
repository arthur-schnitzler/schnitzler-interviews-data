            <p>»What would you do if you were God?«</p>
            <p>»I don’t know,« replied <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur Schnitzler</rs> with a
               smile, »but I should try to do better.«</p>
            <p>My query, suggested to me by a quatrain from <rs type="person" ref="#5393">Omar
                  Khayyam</rs> and by a poem of <rs type="person" ref="#11640">Heine</rs>, amused
               the <rs type="place" ref="#41240">Austrian</rs> playwright.</p>
            <p>»Would you make the rivers run with champagne like <rs type="person" ref="#11640"
                  >Heine</rs> in his dream of omnipotence, or would you shatter the sorry scheme of
               things entirely to bits, like the <rs type="person" ref="#5393" subtype="implied"
                  >Persian poet</rs>?«</p>
            <p>»I would not shatter it to bits,« replied the writer whose fame, more enduring than
               the Empire of <rs type="person" ref="#2513">Francis Joseph</rs>, has outlived a World
               War, »and I would not turn the water into champagne, except perhaps in the arid areas
               of the <rs type="place" ref="#175">United States</rs>. I do not need omnipotence. I
               am on excellent terms with the universe. I am no pessimist. My only grudge against
               the gods is that they have made life too short.«</p>
            <p>Although <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> has advanced several steps
               over the threshold of his sixth decade, neither his bronzed face nor his eager eyes,
               – eyes that have looked deeply into the heart of woman, – betray his age. </p>
            <p>It was after dinner. We were seated on the veranda of his house, overlooking his
               garden in one of the most aristocratic quarters of Vienna. The garden was ablaze with
               blossoms. Straight over our heads a languorous moon buried its pale head in our
               wine.</p>
            <p>»Life,« the playwright remarked, amplifying his previous statement, »would be too
               short, even if we were all ›<rs type="person" ref="#5257">Steinached</rs>‹ or if <rs
                  type="person" ref="#2381">Shaw</rs>’s Creative Evolution prolonged our span by
               several centuries.«</p>
            <p>»Do you want to live as long as Methuselah?«</p>
            <p>»What,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> exclaimed, shrugging his
               shoulders, »are a thousand years, compared to eternity?«</p>
            <p>»Do you think mankind will be able to correct the error of Providence in making human
               life so brief? Do you believe that your compatriot, <rs type="person" ref="#5257"
                  >Steinach</rs>, is on the road to discover the elixir of youth?« </p>
            <p>
               <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> is not only a practicing poet. He also
               is (or was) a practicing physician.</p>
            <p>»<rs type="person" ref="#5257">Steinach</rs>,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121"
                  >Schnitzler</rs> replied, »is moving undoubtedly in the right direction. He is on
               the threshold of the workshop where the World Spirit weaves the woof of life. The
               wonder world of our internal secretions holds the key to the riddle of all life. </p>
            <p>»In that world, we must be prepared for surprises. <rs type="person" ref="#5265"
                  >Columbus</rs>, seeking a new way to the <rs type="place" ref="#55724">East
                  Indies</rs>, discovered <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs>. <rs
                  type="person" ref="#5257">Steinach</rs>, in search of rejuvenation, may have
               stumbled unexpectedly upon an extraordinary discovery.</p>
            <p>»The <rs type="person" ref="#5257">Steinach</rs> operation seems to be a deterrent of
               cancer. It would be cruel to hold out hopes that may be illusory, until we have
               before us the authentic records of a thousand cases. Nevertheless, it seems to me
               that it would be advisable to try the <rs type="person" ref="#5257">Steinach</rs>
               operation in all hopeless cases where the slight surgical interference involved can
               do no possible harm.</p>
            <p>»I am, as you see, interested in the mysteries of the body. I am even more interested
               in the mysteries of the soul. Even if we solve all the secrets of our physical
               functions, the secrets of life will elude us still. We can dissect the optical nerve.
               We can reproduce the mechanism of the human eye. But this does not explain the
               miracle of sight!</p>
            <p>»Even if we guessed all the riddles of the universe to-day, other riddles would face
               us to-morrow. Life always creates new wonders. Everything changes. Everything is new.
               Every hour gives birth to a new world.«</p>
            <p>»Does not nature plagiarize herself constantly?«</p>
            <p>»Nature may use the same patterns again and again,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121"
                  >Schnitzler</rs> replied, »just as a poet may use again and again the same types,
               just as a painter may paint the same model many times in many forms. Nevertheless,
               every leaf she fashions differs from every other leaf in the forest.</p>
            <p>»When nature repeats herself, we recognize her infinite variety. When a poet repeats
               himself, we say he is growing stale. There is nothing to justify this conclusion. The
               poet, like nature, seeks perfection by experimenting with the same material. </p>
            <p>»Critics do not seem to realize this. Modern criticism, like modern government, works
               by catch words and slogans.«</p>
            <p>»You are,« I said, »a philosopher.« </p>
            <p>»No,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> answered, stroking his beard, »I
               am not a philosopher. Fortunately there is not a philosophical system that fits the
               multiple aspects of the universe. The very variety of life, its refusal to permit any
               permanent classification, enables me to draw my daily breath joyfully. Age adds zest
               to my curiosity. As I grow older, I extract more enjoyment from every experience.
               Every year makes me richer.«</p>
            <p>»Then,« I said, »you are never bored?«</p>
            <p>»Boredom is an affectation, when it is not a disease. It reflects a state of mind
               which I detest. I remember a <rs type="person" ref="#13719" subtype="implied">fellow
                  pupil</rs> in school who, on the death of someone, remarked to me, ›I wish I were
               in his place.‹ I always hated the boy for this pose. I never even pretended to be
               blase. I am sometimes bored by others. I am never bored when I am alone.«</p>
            <p>Solitude has no terrors for <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>.</p>
            <p>»I would not be bored,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> continued, »if
               I were the last man alive in the icy solitude of the <rs type="place" ref="#59096"
                  >North Pole</rs>. One can always think. Thinking is the healthiest exercise.«</p>
            <p>»Is that how you keep yourself young?«</p>
            <p>»I always write at least two plays at the same time. When my mind grows a little
               tired of one, I turn to the other. And as a matter of mental gymnastics, I always
               read several books simultaneously. I do not mean that I can read more than one book
               at once, but I dip now into one, now into the other, to keep my brain fresh.«</p>

               the theatre. With a skill no less amazing he makes a human heart tick for us in his
               novels.</p>
            <p>I expected <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> to lift for me at least a
               fringe of the veil that shrouds the mystery of human passion. But the word woman was
               hardly mentioned. Our conversation, which covered every angle of the
               poet-playwright’s philosophy of life, barely skirted the subject of love.</p>
            <p>»We <rs type="place" ref="#175">Americans</rs>,« I remarked, »look upon you as the
               master interpreter of modern eroticism, to whom woman’s soul is a stringed instrument
               on which he plays.«</p>
            <p>»You flatter me,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> said with a smile,
               »and you do an injustice. I deal with all problems. I cannot ignore love, mainspring
               of all human actions. But I am not an erotic author. I am far more interested in
               social problems and in the problems of the family than in eroticism.</p>
            <p>»Most people seem to ignore my unique achievement of writing an entire play without a
               heroine. I refer to my <rs type="work" ref="#30203">
                  <hi rend="italics">Dr. Bernhardi</hi>
               </rs>, which deals primarily with the problem of medical ethics. <rs type="work"

                  <date>November&#8239;1, 1918</date>, when the Revolutionists were seizing the
               city. In spite of the excitement we produced the play.</p>
            <p>»One gets used to living in a burning house,« the playwright added. »It is easier to
               live through great catastrophes than to miss small comforts. I remember how, shortly
               after the War, I searched <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> in vain for a cake
               of chocolate.«</p>
            <p>»Has your knowledge as a doctor helped you in writing your plays?«</p>
            <p>»My medical training helps me to understand the problem of human conduct. I
               anticipated the <rs type="person" ref="#11370">Freud</rs>ian theory of the dream in
               my plays. Many of my plots came to me in my dreams. This should not seem strange.
               Every play is produced in the soul of the dramatist before it is staged in a theatre.
               A play is a conversation of the dramatist with himself. In portraying dramatic
               conflicts, the dramatist wrestles with his soul.</p>
            <p>»In some respects, I am the double of Professor <rs type="person" ref="#11370"
                  >Freud</rs>, <rs type="person" ref="#11370">Freud</rs> himself once called me his
               psychic twin. I tread in literature the same path which <rs type="person"
                  ref="#11370">Freud</rs> explores with amazing audacity in science.</p>
            <p>»Both the poet and the psycho-analyst look through the window of the soul. <rs
                  type="person" ref="#5390">Leibnitz</rs> said the soul has no ›windows.‹ <rs
                  type="person" ref="#11370">Freud</rs> proves him wrong. Psycho-analysis opens
               windows of the soul. <rs type="person" ref="#11370">Freud</rs> is a genius who has
               laid the cornerstone of the new science of man. In hailing him as such I am not bound
               to accept every vagary of his pupils. Somewhere, in the depths, <rs type="person"
                  ref="#11370">Freud</rs> is right. But one must not take him too literally, nor is
               it safe to generalize from his conclusions.«</p>
            <p>»Do you accept the tenets of the Behaviorists who deny completely the freedom of the
               will?«</p>
            <p>»No,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> answered. »I am turning away more
               and more from my earlier mechanistic conceptions. I believe in Free Will. Man is
               responsible for his actions. I could not live in a world without responsibility.</p>
            <p>»I can decide by my own volition if I shall walk toward the right or toward the left.
               In the moral sphere as well as in the sphere of space, conduct is self-determined.
               Man is the master of his soul, even if his freedom of choice be limited by
               circumstance and hampered by heredity.</p>
            <p>»Even if our actions in life are, to an extent, pre-determined, in art we are free,
               in art we can choose. I can develop my characters in accordance with my volition, I
               can fashion my heroes at will. I am convinced that I am also my own master in life.
               If I am not, I nevertheless must act <hi rend="italics">as if</hi> my will were free,
               or human society would crumble into fantastic ruins.</p>
            <p>»If you ask me to prove that the will is free, I must confess my inability. Certain
               things cannot be argued. One must rely on intuition. One knows that they are so.«</p>
            <p>»To what extent do you depend on your intuition?«</p>
            <p>»Intuition,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> replied, »is an invaluable
               guide in art, in politics, in business and in love. Even our friendships are largely
               determined by ›hunches.‹ When I meet people for the first time, I immediately know if
               I am going to like them.</p>
            <p>»Do you believe that your intuitions are inspired by a divine power?«</p>
            <p>»Perhaps,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> replied.</p>
            <p>»Have you any formal religion?«</p>
            <p>»No. I believe in the holy trinity of Spirit, Conscience and Will – Free Will. Spirit
               inspires, Conscience directs, Will propels, our action. Genius and strength are an
               expression of the Spirit. They are also an expression of Will.</p>
            <p>»How can anyone doubt the potency of Will who has read the story of Napoleon? <rs
                  type="person" ref="#4769">Napoleon</rs> willed to be a ruler. Arduously he
               prepared himself for his task. He actually engaged a great actor, <rs type="person"
                  ref="#5262">
                  <anchor type="textConst" xml:id="T_I072-1"/>Talma<note type="textConst"

               </rs>, for the purpose of learning the regal manner of walking. He needed no such
               lesson. <rs type="person" ref="#4769">Napoleon</rs> would have been a ruler even if
               there had been no <rs type="place" ref="#166">French</rs> Revolution.</p>
            <p>»When <rs type="person" ref="#4769">Bonaparte</rs> lost his empire, and lived in <rs
                  type="place" ref="#49152">Elba</rs>, he still ruled like an emperor, made
               improvements, held grande fêtes, drove a carriage with six horses and maintained the
               ceremonial of a great court. He remained every inch a king even in <rs type="place"
                  ref="#49155">St. Helena</rs>.«</p>
            <p>»You are not a monarchist?«</p>
            <p>»I am neither a monarchist nor a republican. I am interested in human phenomena. I am
               interested in <rs type="person" ref="#4769">Napoleon</rs> because he is the most
               perfect example of the exceptional individual.«</p>
            <p>»You are, I take it, an individualist?«</p>
            <p>»Exactly. As such I oppose Bolshevism. I oppose Bolshevism not for political reasons,
               but because Bolshevism denies differentiation.</p>
            <p>»Differentiation is a fundamental law of nature. If man were not differentiated, he
               would be a monstrosity standing outside the pale of nature. To negate personality is
               to repudiate culture. I am disgusted by men of letters who coquette with Bolshevism.« </p>
            <p>»It seems to me that it is not necessary to take parlor Bolshevists too
               seriously.«</p>
            <p>»The parlor Bolshevist serves the forces of disruption. To encourage chaos is an
               unforgiveable offence. It is a sin against the Holy Ghost of Creation.«</p>
            <p>»It seems to me that a man whose knowledge of the human soul enables him to probe the
               nethermost layers of consciousness would be inclined to be all-forgiving?«</p>
            <p>»Understanding by no means implies forgiveness. ›<hi rend="italics">Tout comprendre
                  c’est tous pardonner</hi>‹ is a vicious falsehood. To forgive all implies
               surrender of one’s personality, the forfeiture of one’s judgment.</p>
            <p>»I do not forgive all. I have, on the contrary, strong antipathies. My antipathies
               are stronger than my sympathies.«</p>
            <p>»What,« I ventured, »are your pet aversions?«</p>
            <p>»My pet aversions,« came <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>’s reply with
               the promptness of three shots from a machine gun, »are <rs type="person" ref="#4016"
                  >Wilson</rs>, <rs type="person" ref="#12431">Poincaré</rs> and <rs type="person"
                  ref="#5252">Lenin</rs>. These men were three great misfortunes, disasters,
               catastrophes, for the world.«</p>
            <p>»You do not include <rs type="person" ref="#4719">Clemenceau</rs>?«</p>
            <p>»No. <rs type="person" ref="#4719">Clemenceau</rs> was only a minor misfortune. But
                  <rs type="person" ref="#5252">Lenin</rs> stands for the dissolution of
               civilization. <rs type="person" ref="#4016">Wilson</rs> destroyed idealism. His
               failure made idealism contemptible. <rs type="person" ref="#12431">Poincaré</rs>
               represents the unbending legal mind which in all ages has been the bane of
               humanity.«</p>
            <p>»Are you not, perhaps, a little too severe on <rs type="person" ref="#4016"
                  >Wilson</rs>? His aim was high, even if it failed of its accomplishment.«</p>
            <p>»<rs type="person" ref="#4016">Wilson</rs>,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121"
                  >Schnitzler</rs> remarked, getting up excitedly from the table, »was an ignoramus.
               Ignorance, too, is a sin. In spite of his professions as the arbiter of the world, he
               did not have the most elementary notions of geography. He knew less of <rs
                  type="place" ref="#468">European</rs> geography and history than any <rs
                  type="place" ref="#41240">Austrian</rs> schoolboy.«</p>
            <p>»I was given incredible instances of <rs type="person" ref="#4016">Wilsons</rs>’s
               ignorance by a <rs type="person" subtype="implied" ref="#27744">member</rs> of the
                  <rs type="org" ref="#59099">American Mission</rs> in <rs type="place" ref="#50"
                  >Vienna</rs>. The entire Peace Treaty, especially his treatment of my own country,
                  <rs type="place" ref="#41240">Austria</rs>, is a monument to his ignorance.</p>
            <p>»I detest all professional politicians. I cannot understand how anyone can be a
               professional politician. If he must strut on the stage of politics, he should at
               least know his part.« </p>
            <p>»Have you ever,« I asked, »as a student of human life, attempted to classify human
               beings according to their types or professions?«</p>
            <p>»I have played with the idea,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> replied.
               »I have even written an <rs type="work" ref="#30051" subtype="implied">essay</rs> to
               explain two diagrams in which I attempt to depict the human types. The first diagram
               illustrates the expression of the Spirit through the medium of words. The second
               depicts the expression of the Spirit through action.</p>
            <p>»Each diagram is composed of two triangles, divided by a line–the line of division
               between the positive and the negative. At the apex of the positive triangle stands
               God as the highest human conception. At the apex of the negative triangle I place the
               Devil.</p>
            <p>»I classify men as statesmen, poets, priests, charlatans, politicians, villains, etc.
               The types of mind indicated on the corresponding sides of the upper and lower
               triangle of each group have much in common, except a plus and a minus sign. The type
               of mind above the line being positive, is prefixed by a plus. The mind below the line
               is negative or destructive. </p>
            <p> »The politician, for instance, is a statesman with a minus sign. The discoverer and
               the adventurer, the hero and the swindler, the builder and the speculator, the
               historian and the journalist, the leader and the tyrant, the nature student and the
               charlatan, the poet and the literary man, are positive and negative expressions
               respectively of the same qualities.</p>
            <p>»The statesman may sometimes be compelled to resort to the practices of the
               politician. The politician may, in a rare moment, achieve the wisdom of the
               statesman. The literary man may, under the influence of a great personal experience,
               produce a great poem. Nevertheless, the types remain clearly defined.</p>
            <p>»In the long run, no man can escape from being himself. He may conceal certain
               qualities, he may dissemble his true nature, but eventually, he will betray himself,
               eventually his greatness or his weakness will find him out.</p>
            <p>»To the positive types the world owes its progress. They create its eternal values.
               The negative types are usually a hindrance to mankind. Their work is destructive or
               ephemeral.«</p>
            <p>»Does this classification embrace women as well as men?« I asked. </p>
            <p>»There is no sex in the world of the Spirit,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121"
                  >Schnitzler</rs> replied, as he placed before me a little sketch which contained
               his remarkable classification. </p>
            <p>»Don’t take this classification too seriously. Nature refuses to be reduced to a set
               of rules. No one can imprison the World Spirit in a syllogism. My diagram is merely a
               playful attempt to clarify my own mind, an experiment, not a final conclusion.
               Nevertheless, you will understand my detestation of <rs type="person" ref="#4016"
                  >Wilson</rs>, <rs type="person" ref="#12431">Poincaré</rs> and <rs type="person"
                  ref="#5252">Lenin</rs>, because they typify the triumph of the negative: they are
               sons of chaos, not sons of God.« </p>
            <p>»Are your likes as pronounced as your dislikes?« I questioned. </p>
            <p>»My sympathies are less pronounced but more widely distributed, than my
               antipathies.«</p>
            <p>»Do you admire any statesman or politician in <rs type="place" ref="#468"
               >Europe</rs>?«</p>
            <p>»I do not.«</p>
            <p>»Who are the greatest contemporary authors in <rs type="place" ref="#151"
                  >Germany</rs> and in <rs type="place" ref="#41240">Austria</rs>?«</p>
            <p>»I like <rs type="person" ref="#12176">Thomas</rs> and <rs type="person" ref="#12170"
                  >Heinrich Mann</rs>. <rs type="person" ref="#11740">Hofmannsthal</rs> is a great
               poet. <rs type="person" ref="#13055">Wassermann</rs> is a great novelist. I attribute
                  <rs type="person" ref="#12176">Thomas Mann</rs>’s greatness in part to the
               patience of his labor in the vineyards of God. He worked more than twelve years on

            <p>»There are other writers in <rs type="place" ref="#151">Germany</rs>, in <rs
                  type="place" ref="#41240">Austria</rs> and in other lands whom I admire. It is
               impossible to catalogue an entire literature in one conversation.« </p>
            <p>»Is there any poet among the new generation who deserves to be called great?«</p>
            <p>
               <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> shook his head. »It is difficult to
               tell. I do not read one-twentieth, probably not one-hundredth, of all that is
               published. It is possible that much that is significant and important escapes me.
               Experience has made me somewhat suspicious of new discoveries. Formerly people were
               afraid to recognize genius for fear of hailing the wrong man. To-day, they salute
               every new author for fear of missing the divinely anointed. This produces a
               generation of pretenders, false gods of literature and philosophy.«</p>
            <p>»Many of the new <rs type="place" ref="#151">German</rs> and <rs type="place"
                  ref="#41240">Austrian</rs> writers have received recognition in <rs type="place"
                  ref="#175">America</rs>,« I remarked.</p>
            <p>»I am glad that such is the case,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs>
               replied. »I hope that <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> will modify her
               copyright laws to protect the writers she claims to admire. I personally have
               suffered much loss because <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> is not a member
               of the <rs type="org" ref="#29486">Geneva Convention</rs> which protects
               authors.«</p>
            <p>»We protect every book printed in the <rs type="place" ref="#175">United States</rs>
               for a definite number of years. Do you advocate a perpetual copyright?«</p>
            <p>»Why not? The man who writes a novel and the man who invents a new process of
               manufacturing is entitled to the same measure of protection as the man who creates
               new values in railroads or in stone, or the man who invests the fruit of his labor in
               a corporation. With certain safeguards for the public, intellectual property should
               be perpetual.</p>
            <p>»Copyrights should be unnecessary. Intellectual property should be as secure without
               special legislation as any other property of man. I have repeatedly expressed this
               idea in conversation with <rs type="place" ref="#175">American</rs> friends, but
               somehow your law makers seem to despise inventors and poets, or they would not
               discriminate against them.«</p>
            <p>»Would you like to see <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs>?« </p>

            <p>»I am not interested in meeting authors, in <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs>
               or elsewhere. A man is not necessarily interesting because he has written an

                  edition</rs> of my works comprises twelve volumes.«</p>
            <p>»When did you begin to write?« </p>
            <p>»My first book was not published until I was thirty, but began to write at the age of
               eleven. I believed that every theme a poet uses exists in him already before he
               reaches the age thirty.« </p>
            <p>»What did you write at eleven?« </p>
            <p><anchor type="label" xml:id="I072_L_tagebuchl"/>»I began to write the story of my
               life. In other words, a <rs type="work" ref="#33243">diary</rs>. I have made an entry
               into this diary every day of my life. It is a complete record of all my thoughts, and
               of all my experiences.</p>
            <p>»You came to me on one of your visits to <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> more
               than six years ago. I can refer to my <rs type="work" ref="#33243">diary</rs> and
               tell you every word you said. I know that one of the subjects that we discussed then
               was the question of copyright.«</p>
            <p>»Do you expect to publish your <rs type="work" ref="#33243">diary</rs>?«</p>
            <p>»It will not be published until fifty years after my death.«</p>
            <p>»Is your diary written with the same candor as the <rs type="work" ref="#33245"

                  Harris</rs>?«</p>
            <p>»It is not necessary to go beyond the canons of good style, even in the confessional.
               Unabashed brutality of expression is unjust to oneself and unjust to others. The
               human mind is so constituted that candor beyond reason and decency burns itself upon
               the memory so deeply that other more important phases of a book are forgotten.</p>
            <p>»My <rs type="work" ref="#33243">diary</rs> traces my own evolution as a playwright
               and as a man. My first models were <rs type="place" ref="#166">French</rs>. On a
               visit to an <rs type="person" ref="#21028" subtype="implied">uncle</rs> in <rs
                  type="place" ref="#224">London</rs>, I discovered that I had exhausted all his
               German and <rs type="place" ref="#254">English</rs> books. In sheer desperation I
               began to read the <rs type="place" ref="#166">French</rs> dramatists which I found in
               his library. These dramatists colored my early imagination. You can easily discover
               their influence in <rs type="work" ref="#29935">
                  <hi rend="italics">Anatol</hi>

            <p>»Do you care for your early work?«</p>
            <p>»The last child usually seems the dearest. I think the critics are sometimes disposed
               to over-estimate some of my earlier works, at the expense of my more mature
               productions. Every talent has a countenance of its own. It took me some time to find
               myself – to discover my own face, so to speak.« </p>
            <p>»What prompted you to discard your naturalism?«</p>
            <p>»I departed from naturalism but not from nature. Converted to rhythm, I escaped from
               a disagreeable reality into the holy land of style.« </p>
            <p>»Which of your works do you consider your best?«</p>
            <p>»I like <rs type="work" ref="#29941">

               stage economizes in characters. I must write of life as I see it. If I see it crowded
               with characters I cannot banish them from my play or from my story.«</p>
            <p>»What is your attitude toward <rs type="work" ref="#29855">
                  <hi rend="italics">Reigen</hi>
               </rs>, the play that was suppressed so many times?«</p>
            <p>»It is among the least important of my efforts. But the trial which followed its
               suppression, a trial in which censorship itself was on trial, was interesting. The
               testimony alone occupies six hundred pages.« </p>
            <p>Are you now engaged on a play that will surpass all your other works?« </p>
            <p>»It is not always necessary to surpass oneself. All creative work has its ebb and
               tide. No tide advances continuously in one direction.« </p>
            <p>The maid, coming in on tiptoes, filled our glasses with some delightful <rs
                  type="place" ref="#41240">Austrian</rs> wine. The garden was still bathed in
               moonlight.</p>
            <p>»Do you ever work in the open air?« I asked.</p>
            <p>No, <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> replied. »Thoughts come to me most
               easily in my library. I cannot work even under my own trees. Nature has too many
               curious, almost inaudible, voices that distract the attention.</p>
            <p>Somewhere in the neighborhood a clock struck twelve.</p>
            <p>»We have talked for hours,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> remarked
               somewhat sadly, »and yet I do not know if I have really succeeded in expressing
               myself. When I prepare an article, I sometimes rewrite it twelve times before I am
               satisfied. Words, especially the spoken word, are treacherous and elusive.«</p>
            <p>»Why should it be impossible for a writer to achieve finality of expression, to
               discover the one inevitable word to carry his message?« </p>
            <p>»Because,« <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> replied, »we do not think in
               words nor in pictures, but in something that we cannot grasp. If we could grasp it,
               we would have a world language–perhaps the language men spoke before the fall of the
               Tower of Babel and the confusion of tongues. The musician speaks a universal
               language. Emotion is universal. Thought is individual and untranslatable.« </p>

                     (<date>1927</date>)</note> geschrieben zur Erläuterung von zwei Diagrammen, in
               welchen ich die menschlichen Typen aufzuzeichnen versuchte. Das erste Diagramm
               veranschaulicht den Ausdruck des Geistes durch das Mittel von Worten. Das zweite
               beschreibt den Ausdruck des Geistes durch Handlung.</p>
            <p>»Jedes Diagramm besteht aus zwei Dreiecken, die durch eine Linie getrennt sind – die
               Scheidungslinie zwischen dem Positiven und dem Negativen. Auf dem Scheitelpunkt des
               positiven Dreiecks steht Gott als die höchste menschliche Vorstellung. Auf den
               Scheitelpunkt des negativen Dreiecks setze ich den Teufel. </p>
            <p>»Ich teile die Menschen ein als Staatsmänner, Dichter, Priester, Scharlatane,
               Politiker, Gauner usw. Die Geistestypen an den entsprechenden Seiten des oberen und
               des unteren Dreiecks jeder Gruppe haben vieles gemeinsam, mit Ausnahme von einem
               Plus- oder einem Minuszeichen. Der Geistestyp oberhalb der Linie ist positiv und wird
               mit einem Pluszeichen versehen. Der Geist unter der Linie ist negativ oder
               zerstörend. </p>
            <p>»Der Politiker zum Beispiel ist ein Staatsmann mit einem Minuszeichen. Der Entdecker
               und der Abenteurer, der Held und der Schwindler, der Bauherr und der Spekulant, der
               Historiker und der Journalist, der Führer und der Tyrann, der Naturforscher und der
               Scharlatan, der Poet und der Literat sind entsprechend positive und negative
               Ausdrücke derselben Eigenschaften. </p>
            <p>»Der Staatsmann mag bisweilen gezwungen sein, zu den Praktiken des Politikers zu
               greifen. Der Politiker kann sich, in einem seltenen Augenblick, bis zur Weisheit des
               Staatsmannes erheben. Der Literat kann, unter dem Eindruck eines großen persönlichen
               Erlebnisses, eine große Dichtung schaffen. Trotzdem bleiben die Typen klar Umrissen. </p>
            <p>»Auf die Dauer entgeht kein Mensch dem Schicksal er selbst zu sein. Er mag gewisse
               Eigenschaften verbergen, er mag seine wahre Natur verhüllen, aber schließlich<pb/>
               wird er sich selbst verraten, schließlich werden seine Größe oder seine Schwäche
               seiner Herr.</p>
            <p>»Den positiven Typen verdankt die Welt ihren Fortschritt. Sie schaffen ihre ewigen
               Werte. Die negativen Typen sind gewöhnlich für die Menschheit ein Hindernis. Ihr Werk
               ist zerstörerisch oder vorübergehend.«</p>

                  <p>Verehrter Herr Viereck.</p>
                  <p>Vielen Dank für die freundliche Uebersendung des Manuscriptes. Ich habe es mit
                     grossem Interesse gelesen, es ist sehr fesselnd geschrieben; dass es nun doch
                     ein Interview geworden ist liegt nun einmal in der Natur der Sache. Dem Sinne
                     nach haben Sie die anregende und angeregte vierstündige Unterhaltung vom
                     vorigen Sommer zum grossen Teile, wenn auch höchst persönlich gefärbt, vielfach
                     richtig wiedergegeben und so habe ich gegen das Ganze nichts einzuwenden,
                     möchte aber zu Einzelheiten mir einige Bemerkungen gestatten, die ich Sie,
                     lieber Herr Viereck, wenn möglich zu berücksichtigen bitte. Wie ich Ihnen schon
                     in meiner Karte flüchtig geschrieben, wünschte ich alles Allzupersönliche
                     vermieden, wie z.&#8239;B. Ihre Frage nach der Eva im Paradies meines Gartens,
                     die Sie gewiss in dieser Form auch niemals gestellt hatten. <anchor
                        type="label" xml:id="I072_L_genuegtWohl"/>Es genügt wohl zu erwähnen, dass

                  <p>Ich habe auch nicht gesagt, dass es unter der jüngeren Generation keine

                     hundertsten Teil, und dass mir vielleicht gerade sehr Interessantes entgangen
                     ist. (Man sollte überhaupt in solchen Fällen gar keine Namen nennen, das wirkt

                     werden.</p>
                  <p>Sie lassen mich ferner sagen, dass ›<rs type="work" ref="#30207">Das Weite
                        Land</rs>‹ speziell nie in <rs type="place" ref="#175">Amerika</rs>
                     aufgeführt wurde. Das klingt beinahe, als wären beinahe alle meine Stücke
                     englisch in <rs type="place" ref="#175">Amerika</rs> gespielt worden. Indessen
                     ist das nur bei wenigen der Fall gewesen.</p>
                  <p>Zu der Seite mit den einzelnen Bemerkungen aus einem früheren Gespräch mit mir.
                     Ich war nicht 40 Jahre alt, als ich zu schreiben begann, sondern habe schon mit
                     11 Jahren zu schreiben angefangen. Das erste Buch erschien allerdings erst in
                     meinem 30. Lebensjahr.</p>
                  <p>Es wäre im Einzelnen natürlich noch manches zu sagen und wenn ich auch das
                     Porträt, das Sie von mir entwerfen, nicht völlig getroffen finde, geschmeichelt
                     scheint es mir jedenfalls, mit Sympathie und mit Elan entworfen. Ich erinnere
                     mich mit Vergnügen der vier Stunden auf meiner Terrasse, in denen ich Ihnen
                     wissentlich-unwissentlich zu meinem Bild gesessen bin. Ich freue mich auf Ihr
                     Buch und hoffe Sie sehr bald wiederzusehen.</p>
                  <p>Mit den verbindlichsten Grüßen</p>
                  <p>Ihr sehr ergebener</p></quote>
