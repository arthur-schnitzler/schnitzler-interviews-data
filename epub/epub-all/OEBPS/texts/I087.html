            <p><span class="italics">Arthur Schnitzler, Viennese playwright and novelist, an interview with whom is reported
                  below by Karl Scheuermann, a Milwaukee newspaper man, is one of the chief figures
                  in contemporary continental literature. In America, however, he is more widely known
                  for his novels, many of which have been translated from the German, than he is for
                  his plays. Among the former are »Fraulein Else,« »Beatrice,« »Rhapsody« and »Therese,«
                  of which the last named is his longest and was published this fall.</span></p>
            <p>Complications greet the interviewer who would see Arthur Schnitzler, internationally
               known playwright and novelist, at his home in Vienna. For Herr Schnitzler, like most
               famous and much bothered men, is not at home to everybody and to guard against casual
               interruptions at his work has a silent telephone number. Although I have carried on
               a correspondence with him for a matter of 15 years or more, it was necessary for me
               to go through the formality of calling at his home, Sternwartestrasse 71, inquiring
               for his telephone number and then making the telephonic introduction, which he requires,
               at an appointed time.</p>
            <p>Yes, he would be glad to see me he said – sometime within the next day or two. The
               following morning Mr. Schnitzler called to say he would chat with me for an hour or
               so at 6 30 that evening.</p>
            <p>The thing that struck me about the author of »Anatole,« »Reigen,« »<a id="K_I087-12"><!--anchor--></a>Light o Love<span class="note" id="K_I087-12h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Liebelei</span>,« as he stepped from a room on the second floor of his carefully groomed villa, was
               his grayness. A gray beard that had grown beyond the well defined outlines of a Van
               Dyke; <a id="K_I087-2"><!--anchor--></a>gray blue eyes<span class="note" id="K_I087-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span></span> below gray brows and squinting lids: a gray mane combed from the right side of the
               massive head toward the left ear; a gray blue cutaway that seemed almost too tight
               for shoulders chunky rather than broad and indicative of a life at the desk rather
               than on football grounds.</p>
            <p>I recalled his liking for gray from his letters – his <a id="K_I087-14"><!--anchor--></a>stationery<span class="note" id="K_I087-14h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Schnitzlers Briefpapier hatte zeitweise einen bläulich-grauen Ton, doch ändert sich
                  das über die Jahre und lässt sich keine Vorliebe für eine bestimmte Papierfarbe feststellen.</span> was of that color. I was reminded at the same time that here was no longer the Schnitzler
               of the »Anatole« days but a man past 60, careworn and wincing under the reality of
               death, the same death with which he has toyed in so many of his plays and novels and
               which, a few months ago, took from him his beloved daughter.</p>
            <p>Mr Schnitzler did not sit long at a time during our chat of two hours or so. He likes
               to stand or move about while he talks and this is his habit also when he is busy on
               a new novel or play. Mr Schnitzler stands there speaking with a voice of extremely
               musical timbre and with a precision of intonation and liveliness of tempo that bear
               no suggestion of the Viennese or Austrian »I should worry« attitude. He agreed with
               me that the much talked about geniality and social gracefulness of the Viennese are
               but surface elements, that the Viennese is spending too much of his time in the coffee
               house and that the traditional »Schlamperei« in public offices has grown rather than
               decreased in the 10 years that Austria has been a republic. Holidays are declared
               on every pretext.</p>
            <p>»We seem to have so much time here,« said Schnitzler, »but have we? Compared with
               Germany we are making slow progress in our reconstruction work. There are too many
               officials. It seems people must be employed somehow.«</p>
            <p>I have observed that the only time when a Viennese has no time is when he has to make,
               or thinks he has to make, an electric train or street car. He will chase after it
               for a block and swing onto it with an athletic experience that is as remarkable as
               it is suicidal. Now police authorities are considering energetic steps to stop the
               nuisance which, clearly visible legends in all street cars inform you, is strictly
               prohibited by law.</p>
            <p>Mr Schnitzler, by the way, considers railroad and electric train riding the most dangerous
               transportation hazards, more so than a trans-Atlantic boat trip. He would rather fly
               than float, and feels himself nowhere safer than when in an airship.</p>
            <p>»I wouldn't mind a trip to America but for the railroad distances. Once in America
               I would want to see all. New York alone wouldn't do. I have been approached several
               times by lecture tour managers but the financial reward offered does not warrant the
               effort.«</p>
            <p>Which brought the conversation to the chronic emptiness of the Austrian pocketbook
               and the tremendous influence American financial and industrial supremacy is having
               upon all phases of life in Europe today.</p>
            <p>»Anything and everything American is above par, in the public’s imagination as well
               as in the realities of the market,« said Schnitzler. »We imitate and adopt American
               clothes, American music, American plays, American films, American traffic rules, American
               sports, American everything except American energy and success.«</p>
            <p>Of American plays that are now »packing ’em in« over here Mr. Schnitzler had in mind
               »Broadway,« »Chicago,« »An American Tragedy,« »The Trial of Mary Dugan.«</p>
            <p>»It is only seldom that I go to a theater,« the writer of world renowned plays declared.
               »I would go to concerts in years gone, my natural artistic inclination being decidedly
               more toward music than the stage. However, I am a keen frequenter of the kino (movie)
               as it permits one to come and go as one pleases and gives one many things that are
               not possible on the stage. I have seen quite a number of American films. There was
               a time when American pictures were poor, but that time is of the past.«</p>
            <p>There are several persons whom Mr Schnitzler would like to meet should he come to
               America. One is a <a id="K_I087-1"><!--anchor--></a>publisher<span class="note" id="K_I087-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><a id="Label-K_I087-1"><!--anchor--></a>Thomas Seltzer, der <span class="date">1922</span> das Werk zuerst in einer teureren Ausgabe von 3.000 Stück, dann nachdem alle Exemplare
                  verkauft waren, im Folgejahr eine günstigere Ausgabe mit einer Auflage von 3–5.000
                  Stück publizierte, die nach kurzer Zeit um weitere 3.000 erweitert wurde. Bereits
                  für die erste Ausgabe beschränkte sich Seltzers Überweisung auf 200 Dollar Anzahlung
                  und 500 Dollar Bezahlung, nur ein Teil der zustehenden Summe, die Schnitzler am <span class="date">1. 6. 1923</span> in einem Brief an den Verleger mit 1.200 Dollar bezifferte. Auch nach Zahlung durch
                  den Verlag musste Schnitzler mehrmals urgieren, um weitere Beträge zu erhalten. In
                  Folge engagierte den Rechtsanwalt Benjamin Stern, um zu seinem Recht zu kommen, doch
                  noch <span class="date">1926</span> musste Schnitzler ausstehende Zahlungen einfordern. Stern antwortete entgegen der
                  Darstellung in diesem Interview sehr wohl, brachte aber die Sache nicht, wie von Schnitzler
                  gewünscht, zu einem Abschluss.</span> who, he said, paid him a pittance for the limited number edition of »Casanova’s Homecoming,«
               and the other a New York lawyer whom he had engaged to prosecute the publisher but
               from whom he heard nothing after the first exchange of courtesies.</p>
            <p>Schnitzler by the way, is <a id="K_I087-4"><!--anchor--></a>still a practicing physician<span class="note" id="K_I087-4h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Das ist auszuschließen, höchstens, dass er sich im Familien- und Freundeskreis betätigte.</span>, the profession which he followed exclusively before his success as a dramatist and
               novelist. Not a few of his plays are built around themes which have grown out of his
               medical experience. At the literary Burg theater  in Vienna his most frequently played
               drama is »Der Junge Medardus,« followed by »Das Weite Land« and »Komoedie der Verfuehrung.«</p>
