                  d’Oscar Wilde</rs>« and of several books which deal with the perplexities of the

            <p>»In <rs type="place" ref="#166">France</rs> there are probably not twenty authors who
               live from the sale of their books. The majority of them pull through with the help of
                  journalism<c rendition="#dots" n="4"/> I do not see any remedy for the situation.
               There is no way of forcing the public to buy books which do not interest them. If the
               state grants a subvention to certain writers, their art will inevitably suffer, for
               they will become the creatures of the government and their work will trend toward low
               propaganda. The only solution is for imaginative literature, as is already the case
               with poetry, to cease to be a profession and become an avocation. The reason why so
               many mediocre works are published is precisely that their authors expect material
               gain from them. The moment they earn their livelihood in some other fashion, at that
               moment they will stop writing, except when they have something to say. Literature
               will thus gain in quality.</p>

            <p>The disappearance of literature as a profession, then, and the relegation of the
               literary man to the amateur class. The enterprising <rs type="person" subtype="implied" ref="#29080">author</rs> of »<rs type="work" ref="#33139">Quarantième Etage</rs>« and various other books which sell widely in a dozen
               countries no doubt experiences little direct inconvenience from the situation, but he
               has given thought to it. He says: </p>

            <p>»The deplorable conditions under which certain writers are forced to live certainly
               react unfortunately on their literary production<c rendition="#dots" n="4"/> Very few
               writers of reputation are suffering serious distress. But many authors of merit have
               no reputation<c rendition="#dots" n="4"/> A distinction must be made among the
               different <rs type="place" ref="#468">European</rs> countries. A very important consideration is always the number of
               individuals who speak or read the language of the author. The situation is relatively
               very favorable for writers in English, where success means fortune. When <rs type="place" ref="#151">Germany</rs> was
               in a less miserable situation than she is today the life of the <rs type="place" ref="#151">German</rs> artist was
               fairly comfortable, too, when he had crossed the threshold of fame, <rs type="place" ref="#166">French</rs> writers,
               who are so fortunate as to be read not only by the 50,000,000 <rs type="place" ref="#468">Europeans</rs> whose
               language is <rs type="place" ref="#166">French</rs> but in foreign countries, are also relatively favored. But the
               situation is deplorable for the languages which are not widely used, like <rs type="place" ref="#44016">Dutch</rs>,
               <rs type="place" ref="#43430">Czech</rs>, <rs type="place" ref="#44244">Finnish</rs>, etc<c rendition="#dots" n="4"/>

               a little caustically, from his <rs type="place" ref="#49215" subtype="implied">Holstein village</rs>:</p>

               <space dim="vertical" unit="line" quantity="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>»There are in <rs type="place" ref="#151">Germany</rs> a considerable number of
               writers of reputation but without merit. They have gained their reputation through
               the kindness of friends, critics and periodicals, not through their works. Some of
               these writers are having a very hard time in these trying days, but I am inclined to
               think that it is just as well that they should.</p>
            <p>»The story writer of real merit, the writer who has a real story-telling gift, can
               even in these difficult times, by publishing his books first in a newspaper or
               magazine and then in book form, earn as much as will suffice for modest needs. Since
               the inflation left him without means, and since his older works at present bring him
               little or nothing, because very few persons buy books nowadays, he dare not get sick,
               and must, like the undersigned, work on into his old age.</p>
            <p>»Much worse than the situation of the novelist is that of the dramatist, it is very
               possible, even likely, that a <rs type="person" ref="#11933">Heinrich von Kleist</rs>
               would go to his destruction if he were living today, especially since the theaters
               have gone to the devil again (wieder einmal nicht Gottes, sondern des Teufels sind).
               It is just as serious with the poets.</p>
            <p>»This is how things are today. Since they are steadily growing more desperate, it may
               be worse next month. Before the war probably 60 per cent of our population were able
               to buy books and go to the theater. Now not 5 per cent can do so. Who knows how it
               will be by another month?</p>
            <p>»How can conditions be improved? The only thing I can suggest is to kill off
               everybody who favors our dragging our burden of political debt any longer.</p>

               is by direct aid to the needy writers. More important – and in a higher sense –
               would, of course, be a <anchor type="commentary" xml:id="K_M056-11"/>reform of the copyright law<note type='commentary' xml:id="K_M056-11h"><ref type="pointer" target="#I044" subtype="cf"/></note>, or at least a careful observance
               of the existing law, which, as you know, is not now the case. It is unfortunately
               true that spiritual property has never been put on the same plane before the law as
               material property, and so it is constantly happening that direct infractions of
               existing law are not adequately punished or not at all, so that the most disgraceful
               offenders against the regulations concerning spiritual property are allowed to go
               free, not merely unpunished, but even as highly respected citizens. But these things
               cannot be changed overnight, and even if they were changed there will always remain a

               any money now for any of these categories. There is the additional difficulty that
               since the war we have an entirely new literature, and some of the most distinguished
               personalities of pre-war literature have been unable or unwilling to adapt themselves
               to the new conditions, and are as a result living in the direst need. Some of them

               of the general depression. Bad as that is, another circumstance is largely
               responsible for the fact that important writers are in want today and the production
               of a really first-class literature is becoming more and more difficult. The point at
               which the writer makes his living is steadily changing. In the majority of cases it
               is no longer the book, but the periodical, and there the vicious law obtains, imposed
               by the publishers, that the writer must keep in mind that puzzling monster, the
               popular taste. It follows inevitably that the artistic and spiritual standard of the
               production is lowered, and I maintain that there is today no first class writer in
                  <rs type="place" ref="#151">Germany</rs> who is economically able to write
               entirely unhampered, just as his talent prompts him. The economic enslavement of the
