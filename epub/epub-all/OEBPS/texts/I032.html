            <p><a id="I032_L_society"><!--anchor--></a> More than once during the course of my life have I come into contact with anti-Semitism.
               The first time I stumbled against it, I remember today very clearly; evidently it
               had made a very profound impression on me at the time. I was then a medical student
               at the University, here in Vienna, and a few of us were banded together into a sort
               of <a id="KT118-1"><!--anchor--></a>philanthropic society<span class="note" id="KT118-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><a id="L_KT118-1"><!--anchor--></a>Diese Begebenheit erzählt Schnitzler ausführlicher in seiner Autobiografie (<span class="bibl">Jugend in Wien 157–158</span>).</span> whose mission was to give charity to needy students – not very much, just a few shillings
               to help them somewhat. Before the society was very many months <a id="TT118-1"><!--anchor--></a>old<span class="note" id="TT118-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘oll’</span></span>, discrimination set in. When a man was suggested for help, and his name was unmistakably
               Jewish, immediately he was subtly removed from every consideration. I was so struck
               by this unfair treatment that poor Jewish <a id="TT118-2"><!--anchor--></a>students<span class="note" id="TT118-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘stuednts’</span></span> received, that for a long while I fought bitterly against it. It was a hopeless fight,
               as I soon realized – and before long I was compelled to resign from the society. But
               after my graduation from the University, I was to learn that anti-Semitism was an
               everyday problem. As a physician I personally encountered so much of it that this,
               I am sure, more than anything else served to bring me sharply to Judaism and to an
               understanding of and a sympathy for its problems.</p>
            <p><span style="display:inline-block" width="1line"> </span></p>
            <p>However, – although when I first encountered it, I was alarmed and infuriated at all
               anti-Semitism, however slight it might have been – I am not one of those who today
               look upon it as a very grave problem. Not that I deny the existence of anti-Semitism
               everywhere, but, frankly, I do not think it is a very important problem. As a matter
               of fact, I look upon anti-Semitism as a healthy influence in<span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e278">[Page]</span> the life of the Jew. Every once in a while a Jew will come to me, his face red with
               anger, his eyes flaming and desperate, and he will tell me how he has been the object
               of some anti-Semite’s obvious discrimination. I always try to calm such infuriated
               Jews and to tell them that they should not, after all, take such discrimination very
               seriously. It is just such discrimination – more than all the legends and religious
               worship – I tell them, which has kept Judaism palpitantly alive through the ages.
               And it is true. At least, I am convinced of it. Religion, that is strict religious
               beliefs according to age-old customs and traditions, has with each passing century
               become a weaker and weaker influence in the life of the ordinary Jew. We all see,
               each day, how little it plays a part in the everyday life of you and me, who, notwithstanding
               our disregard of the laws, still remain good Jews at heart. But though religious worship
               is becoming a weaker influence, racial patriotism persists tenaciously in the heart
               of every Jew, and as strongly as ever before. And the reason it does so, is because
               the average Jew well realizes that he is envied, abused, the object of the Christian
               world’s scorn and contempt. I do not, for example, believe that Jews were ever so
               radically patriotic as in these sordid years, of the past century, when they suffered
               the lash of persecution.</p>
            <p>Persecution, fortunately, has died out. Its legitimate offspring is anti-Semitism.
               And this anti-Semitism, I say, is serving a very useful purpose in constantly reminding
               the Jew that he is, after all, very individual; that he is, after all, very different
               from his Christian neighbour; that his only salvation in this world is to recognize
               this difference and to openly acknowledge it. Anti-Semitism, I feel, is constantly
               serving the healthy purpose of bringing into the heart of every Jew, far more forcefully
               than any other influence, I know of at the present moment, a patriotism for his race,
               and a love for his brother-Jews. That is why I say that anti-Semitism is a healthy
               influence.</p>
            <p>And then, why should we not reconcile ourselves gracefully to something that is so
               obviously inevitable as anti-Semitism is? Nothing that we can do can possibly overcome
               and put an end to anti-Semitism; it is simply out of the question. Anti-Semitism is
               a perfectly human failing of a perfectly human society. When a group of people is
               different from the vast majority, that group of people is certain to be scorned and
               held in contempt. And when that group, though in a minority, succeeds in forging to
               the front – in the world of art and industry and finance – envy is almost certain
               to light up the contempt of the majority into the mighty flame of hate.</p>
            <p>Realizing this, namely that anti-Semitism is inevitable in a human society, the Jew
               can do either of two things. He can either eliminate anti-Semitism by eliminating
               that which causes it. Or, in other words, he can surrender his race and its heritage.
               An absurd solution, to be sure! The other, and far more sensible, plan is simply to
               tolerate anti-Semitism as the fate that inevitably belongs to the Jew, a fate which
               cannot be changed. Spinoza once wrote that an evil which is inevitable ceases to be
               an evil. For example, we die – certainly one of the most colossal tragedies in the
               life of the human-being (can anything be more evil than <a id="T_I032-22"><!--anchor--></a>death?).<span class="note" id="T_I032-22h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘death?)’</span></span> Yet, do we ever stop to worry over it? No. The fact that it is inevitable simply
               eliminates it as an evil; we accept it as a fact. Just so, should anti-Semitism be
               accepted. To fight against it is useless and merely serves to augment anti-Semitism,
               and not to diminish it. One cannot expect human-beings to be anything but human. Their
               shortcoming, however painful they may be sometimes, simply have to be understood –
               and tolerated.</p>
            <p><span style="display:inline-block" width="1line"> </span></p>
            <p>I am often asked if I believe that anti-Semitism will ever die. All things die in
               this world, and some day, in some way that I cannot for the moment foresee, anti-Semitism
               will go the way of all flesh. But that day is far, far off. Anti-Semitism is destined
               to linger as long as Jews remain Jews. For one thing, the causes of anti-Semitism
               can never be eliminated. Jews will always be different; Jews will always, I am sure,
               continue to be at the front of human activity; Jews must always be in a minority.
               Jews therefore will inevitably always be hated. And then, anti-Semitism is such a
               convenient thing! It is so convenient to discriminate, when discrimination is necessary.
               If, for example, a university is crowded, isn’t it convenient to put a ban against
               Jews? And in the case of our little philanthropic society, wasn’t discrimination against
               the Jew started because it was convenient – namely, more of the money could go to
               Christian students? Why, then, should society abandon anything so convenient? Especially
               since there is cause, from their point of view, for their discrimination? No. Some
               day perhaps a race of Supermen will appear in this world, in whom envy, hate, malice
               and contempt will be altogether foreign. But until such a time comes, the Jew is destined
               to suffer the stings and arrows of anti-Semitism.</p>
            <p>However, as I have already said, the Jews should, not feel too deeply against – anti-Semitism.
               Strange to say, anti-Semitism is an evil which gives fruit to good. The Christians
               hope to annihilate us with their contempt; their contempt really makes us flourish.
               For never are we Jews more truly conscious of our race as when we realize that we
               are hated.</p>

                  Leute, daß mir nicht jeder Einzelne im Gedächtnis bleibt. Eines weiß ich aber bestimmt,
                  daß ich nie einem dieser Besucher das Recht gegeben hatte ein Privatgespräch zum Zwecke
                  einer Veröffentlichung zu verwenden. Manches, was in dem Artikel steht, habe ich wohl
                  gesagt, ich weiß nicht, ob zu Herrn Mahler oder zu jemandem andern; das Meiste aber ist, ich will nicht geradezu sagen erfunden,
                  aber doch so stilisiert, daß meine eigene Ansicht und auch, wie ich glaube, mein Wesen
                  keineswegs so herauskommt, wie es der Wirklichkeit entspricht. Übrigens ist der Artikel
                  rein journalistisch genommen gar nicht so übel und gewiß von den besten Absichten
