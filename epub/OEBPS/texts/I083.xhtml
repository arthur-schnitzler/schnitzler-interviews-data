            <p><span class="capitals">Vienna</span>, <span class="date">February 12</span>. – A drama of tempestuous love has brought about what verges on a Ministerial crisis
               here, and events during the last two days in that august body, the Austrian Parliament,
               have been themselves dramatic.</p>
            
            <p>On Thursday Parliament heard the amazing news that the current deficit exceeds 42
               milliards of crowns. One would have supposed that this disclosure of appalling bankruptcy
               would have set the Assembly agog. But no. Members took it calmly – in fact, with bored
               indifference. There were a few stifled yawns, a brief mechanical debate, and the House
               passed to another topic.</p>
            
            <p>Yesterday the same Parliament was informed that the play, »Reigen,« which Arthur Schnitzler
               wrote 24 years ago, and which is now being produced in Vienna, has been forbidden
               by the Minister of the Interior, because it contains certain amorous scenes which
               exceed what this Clerical Government considers to be the limits of decorum.</p>
            
            <p>No sooner had the subject been broached than a veritable maelstrom engulfed the House.
               M. P.s pounded on benches, whistles and catcalls echoed from the opposing sides. Clerical
               and Socialist members moved toward each other with brandished fists and blows were
               <a id="T_I083-1"><!--anchor--></a>exchanged.<span class="note" id="T_I083-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘exchanged’</span></span></p>
            
            <p>Cries of »the Minister of the Interior must go!« »Out with the rascal!« were heard.</p>
            
            <p>The Minister, Herr Glanz, replied by describing the Socialists as the protectors of
               indecency, to which Otto Bauer objected vociferously. Karl <a id="T_I083-12"><!--anchor--></a>Seitz<span class="note" id="T_I083-12h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span><span class="quote">‘Saitz’</span></span> (Majority Socialist), an ex-President of the Republic, declared that if the Clericals
               are determined to employ violence the Socialists will retort with forcible resistance.</p>
            
            <p>The admission of the State’s insolvency had left the Government intact, but the Social
               Democrats, who have humbly accepted the miserable lot of the Austrian worker as inevitable,
               are heard issuing a summons for armed class conflict because adultery is committed
               on a darkened theatrical stage.</p>
            
            <p>The Minister’s decree has been defied by the <a id="K_implied_12511"><!--anchor--></a> Socialist Mayor <span class="note" id="K_implied_12511h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Jakob Reumann</span> of Vienna, who has given orders that Schnitzler’s production shall proceed unmolested.
               And so, naturally the play, which had been presented to modest audiences of aesthetes,
               is now being given before packed houses.</p>
            
            <p>»Is the author responsible for the public?« exclaimed Dr. Schnitzler, when I interviewed
               him. »Shall I stand at the door and psycho-analyse each person entering the theatre
               to determine whether he is impelled there by erotic motives?«</p>
            
            <p>»Reigen«, I may add, was <a id="K_I083-1"><!--anchor--></a>first performed last year<span class="note" id="K_I083-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>In Russland war das Stück urheberrechtsfrei, weswegen es ohne Zustimmung Schnitzlers
                  inszeniert werden konnte. Die Uraufführung von Reigen fand aber am <span class="date">13. 10. 1912</span> in Budapest statt.</span> in Russia, in the Moscow, Petrograd, and Irkutsk theatres.</p>
