            <p><span class="italics"><span class="capitals">Religion</span> has become a current topic even on the crowded front pages of the metropolitan newspapers.
                  In the general recension of thought following the intellectual upheaval that is an
                  aftermath of the war, men and women have turned the searchlight of inquiry to the
                  fundamentals of life; and religion whether positive or negative is one of the basic
                  impulses of the human soul. With this in mind The American Hebrew has requested several
                  well-known American and European writers to subject themselves to a spiritual X-ray,
                  and record the findings graphically for our readers. We present herewith the first
                  two of these self-dissections by Arthur Schnitzler, keen analyst of human motives
                  and emotions, and by <a id="K_I086-11"><!--anchor--></a>Arthur Guiterman</span><span class="note" id="K_I086-11h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Sein Beitrag folgt auf Schnitzlers, wird aber hier nicht wiedergegeben. Danach wird

            <p><span class="italics">The Viennese playwright-philosopher-novelist is best known for the human warmth that
                  permeates his writings and the courage with which he scourges social sham. His irony
                  and wit is akin to that of Bernard Shaw, whose spiritual brother he undoubtedly is.
                  »<a id="K_I086-45"><!--anchor--></a>None but the Brave</span><span class="note" id="K_I086-45h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Lieutenant Gustl, in der Übersetzung von Richard Leo Simon, erschienen <span class="date">1926</span></span><span class="italics">« (Simon and Schuster) is the latest of his many works to be published in America</span>.</p>
            
            <p>I am inclined to say that there is no basic individual Jewish characteristic apart
               from certain traits acquired through force of environment. I do not believe that the
               Jew is essentially different from his Gentile fellow being; there is no difference
               of spiritual rhythm between them. The attitude of the world towards him has produced
               certain psychological modifications. Remove this attitude and those modifications
               will vanish.</p>
            
            <p>I believe that if a child of Jewish parentage, even of the humblest sort, were to
               be taken to another country, kept in ignorance of its origin, and if that origin were
               also kept from its associates, this child would grow up absolutely unconscious of
               a difference between its playmates and itself – save perhaps that it might develop
               and become aware of a keener and quicker brain.</p>
            
            <p>I have no hesitancy in affirming that the Jews are a creative people. We may be on
               the verge of a great artistic Jewish renaissance. Just what is the nature of the artistic
               message Judaism has to convey to the world, I am unable to say. Time alone will tell.</p>
            
            <p>As for the so-called Jewish problem, there is no <a id="K_I086-1"><!--anchor--></a>general solution<span class="note" id="K_I086-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>ab hier handelt es sich um eine überarbeitete Passage aus dem Interview mit Benvenisti,
                  </span> for it. Zionism does not seem to me to be a solution at all. It seems to me actuated
               too much by sudden impulses, by resentment, by a mere desire to escape from one’s
               environment and scarcely ever to spring from a wellreasoned decision. Though I admire
               people who dream so splendidly, they cannot ever convince me. The Zionist plays actively
               into the hand of the anti-Semite; he confesses a weakness in our position which, to
               my mind, does not exist.</p>
            
            <p>I regard Zionism as the worst affliction that had ever burst upon the Jews I do not
               mind recognizing Zionism as a moral principle and a social movement, if it could honestly
               be regarded in that light, but the idea of the foundation of a Jewish State on a religious
               and national basis strikes me as a nonsensical defiance of the whole spirit of historical
               evolution.</p>
            
            <p>My parents, for instance, came from Hungary, but I have no desire to return either
               to Hungary or to Palestine. I am rooted here in Vienna, I am an integral part of its
               highly individual culture; it in turn is a part of me. What care I about the opinion
               of a few ill-bred fools toying with anti-Semitism.</p>
            
            <p>However, I’ll admit that in spite of my complete indifference to every single form
               of religion, I would positively never allow myself to be baptized, even if it were
               possible – though that is less the case today than ever it was – to escape once and
               for all anti-Semitic bigotry and villainy by a dodge like that.</p>
