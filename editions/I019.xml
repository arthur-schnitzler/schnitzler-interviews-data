Keen and penetrating,
               brilliant and subtle, a master of irony and satire, yet sincere and full of optimism,
               this master builder of the modern <rs type="place" ref="#41240">Austrian</rs> drama,
               this <rs type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs> man of letters has impressed himself
               profoundly upon the literature of <rs type="place" ref="#41240">Austria</rs> in the
               face of innumerable difficulties.</p>
            <p>By the sheer force of his art, as it manifested itself in his works, in masterpiece
               after masterpiece, Dr. <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Arthur Schnitzler</rs>, a Jew,
               has won distinction in <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs>, the very hotbed of
               antisemitism. He has surmounted many obstacles, combating prejudice calmly, yet with
               firm determination.</p>
            <p>
               <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> is at his best when portraying women.
               Painting the mysteries of the enigmatic »eternal feminine« with a master brush,
               attacking the actualities of life in terms of life, he scales the heights of emotions
               and depicts the depths of depravity, analyzing human frailties and shortcomings,
               mercilessly at times, always fearlessly, yet never vulgarizing that which less gifted
               and less tactful dramatists and novelists delight in making vulgar.</p>
            <p>Whether it is in his »<rs type="work" ref="#29935">Anatol</rs>,« a series of dramatic
               episodes of love affairs, written in the beginning of his career in
               <date>1880</date>, but not produced until a few years ago (given here at <rs type="place" ref="#1031">Maxine Elliott’s Theater</rs>, with <rs type="person" ref="#29026">Doris Keane</rs> in one of the characters); whether it is his »<rs type="work" ref="#29917">Amours</rs>« »<rs type="work" ref="#29985">The Lonely
                  Way</rs>,« »<rs type="work" ref="#29903">The Intermezzo</rs>,« »<rs type="work" ref="#30207">The Far Away Country</rs>,« »<rs type="work" ref="#29823">The Fairy

                  »<rs type="work" ref="#29843">The Green Cockatoo</rs>«; or his more recent work,
               in the drama as well as in the novel and the short story, his analytical power, his
               wit and his brilliant dialogue, lift his work into a class all by itself in <rs type="place" ref="#468">European</rs> literature. All his dramas are full of
               virility and deep understanding–different as they are in theme, varied as they are in
               treatment, broad as they are in conception. <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> is never a slave to form or a servant of traditions and
               conventionalities. He is unique among <rs type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs>
               dramatists; he is as characteristic as <rs type="place" ref="#50">Vienna</rs> itself,
               as <rs type="place" ref="#50">Viennese</rs> life, whose gifted interpreter he is.</p>

               <rs type="person" ref="#2121">Schnitzler</rs> is known in <rs type="place" ref="#175">America</rs> by a number of plays which have been produced here from time to

               medicine as his life work, but soon abandoned this for literature. He looks much
               younger than his years. Although depressed by the horrors of the <rs type="place" ref="#468">European</rs> catastrophe, he is nevertheless optimistic as to the
               outcome of the war, believing that the universal peace movement will in time make war
