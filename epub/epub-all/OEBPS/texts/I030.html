            <p>(Many of us would be hard put to give an adequate answer to the question »why are
               you a Jew.« Arthur Schnitzler, the world famous novelist answers that question in
               this exclusive interview obtained for <span class="small_caps">The Israelite</span> and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency).</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">–</p>
            <p>Some of us are Jews only because of an accident of birth. We are Jews only because
               we were born Jews. Others of us, however, are Jews for a much more potent reason.
               We feel our race deeply within us, we react keenly and sensitively to it, we think
               ever in terms of it; That is of a greater importance in branding us Jews than any
               accident of birth can be.</p>
            <p>Arthur Schnitzler, one of the greatest living literary figures in the world, is one
               of the latter. He is one of our most desirable Jews. Although he is primarily a novelist
               and a dramatist – one of the world’s finest – he has time and again lent an eager
               pen for the cause of Judaism.</p>
            <p>In play-form he has given us »Prof. Bernhardi« – one of the most vicious attacks against
               the stupidity of anti-Semitism yet penned. In novel-form he has given us the »Open
               Road«, in which Jewish problems are discussed with penetration, lucidity and power.</p>
            <p>Besides this, there remains the mountain of articles which he has contributed in order
               to clarify the position of the Jew in the modern world, and to attempt to explain
               to him his inmost problems.</p>
            <p>It was to talk about Judaism that I came to visit Arthur Schnitzler in his spacious
               home in a suburb of Vienna. And speak about Judaism he did in great detail, for it
               is ever near to his heart. But most important of all he clearly explained to me why
               it is that he is a Jew.</p>
            <p>»If I am today deeply interested in my race,« he said, »the outstanding reason is
               not because I was born a Jew. Strange to say, as far as I am concerned, this is the
               most negligible reason of all. True, if I had not been born a Jew I could not today
               have been a staunch advocate of my race; that is self-evident. And yet, I must add
               that accident of birth I feel has been the most negligible reason of all in making
               me race-conscious. It was the most negligible influence of all in driving me ultimately
               in the acceptance and in instilling into me a profound interest in and appreciation
               for my race. </p>
            <p>»There are those who, born to strictly pious parents, have been rigidly inculcated
               in Jewish principles and dogmas. Such people, it can be said, are Jews because they
               were born Jews. But with me it is altogether different. My father, a very gifted and
               famous physician, had very slight connections with his race. Religious education never
               entered into my early life; religious thought of any kind never influenced it in the
               least. And so, in the early years of my life, which stretched well beyond my adolescence,
               I could hardly be <a id="K_I030-2"><!--anchor--></a>called a Jew<span class="note" id="K_I030-2h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>der Zweitdruck ergänzt am Satzende: »<span class="quote">‘, although I was born one’</span>«</span>.</p>
            <p>»Why I am a Jew? Certainly, it is not because I think that Jewish culture is the greatest
               of all possible cultures or because I feel that the Jew is the greatest of all possible
               human beings. </p>
            <p>»Chauvinism of any kind whatsoever, I have always felt keenly, is unforgiveably stupid.
               It is true, of course, that it is the tendency of a persecuted race to be chauvinistic,
               especially if it has sensitivity, culture and sensibilities. That is why the Jew must
               always exert especial care in avoiding it. For chauvinism, after all, defeats its
               own purpose. You cannot convince anyone of your profound capabilities if you are continually
               trumpeting about them through bugles. Let your actions speak louder than any words!
               </p>
            <p>»Yes, we may be proud of our racial heritage and of our history, we may refuse ever
               to conceal our identity; but modesty is always an enviable virtue. True, I have in
               recent years come to realize that there is a unique importance to Jewish culture and
               that the Jew contributed much to the world of thought. But every man of learning realizes
               that the Jew has not been alone in this respect. We must always remember that the
               Jew is only one part of a great civilization.</p>
            <p>»Why, then, am I a Jew? I am a Jew, first of all, because foreign influences have
               driven me <a id="K_I030-17"><!--anchor--></a>willy-nilly<span class="note" id="K_I030-17h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>amerikanisches Englisch: geradewohl</span> to my faith. I am certain that if I were living in the best of all possible worlds
               where race-hatred, anti-Semitism, Jew-baiting were all unspeakable and unheard of,
               I would no more be conscious of my faith than the most stout-hearted skeptic. In such
               a world, I am sure, race consciousness would be of very little importance or necessity.
               It would, as a matter of fact, be diminished a hundred fold. But since we are not
               living in such a world, conditions everywhere have driven me into a greater and greater
               race-consciousness.</p>
            <p>»I was first made aware of the fact that I was a Jew during my university days, when,
               as a member of a <a id="KT116-1"><!--anchor--></a>philanthropic society<span class="note" id="KT116-1h"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span></span> which meted out sparse charity to needy students, I was made aware of the fact that
               Jewish students were openly discriminated against. That made a profound impression
               upon me. It opened my eyes to a condition which had always existed but to which I
               had been as blind as a mole.</p>
            <p>»From that time on I realized how much injustice, how much blind and hot-tempered
               hate, how much bitterness and stupidity were levelled against the Jew. </p>
            <p>»Always an ally of the oppressed, I became once and for all deeply interested in the
               Jew. Jewish problems became my own intimate problems. I absorbed myself with Jewish
               thought and culture. I had become, suddenly, a Jew in heart and in soul.</p>
            <p>»Of course there must be other <span class="pagebreak" id="index.xml-pb-d31e210">[Page]</span>reasons why I am a Jew. I might point to the fact that my studies in Jewish history,
               culture and thought have awakened something deep within me and that I have found something
               of myself in them. I might point to the fact that I have come to realize that the
               problems of the Jew affect not only people very near to me, but affect me personally
               as well. This, much more than any accident of birth, has made me a Jew.</p>
            <p>»I might add, in conclusion, that being a Jew requires a consummate grace and tact.
               I have already spoken about the stupidity of chauvinism. </p>
            <p>»But chauvinism is not half so bad as a complete indifference to and an avoidance
               of Jewish interests. A Jew should strive to attain something of a golden mean: modest
               and unassuming at some times, but loud-voiced when the emergency presents itself.
               That is the type of Jew I have always strived to be.«</p>
