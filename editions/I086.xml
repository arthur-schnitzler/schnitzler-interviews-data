                  <hi rend="capitals">Religion</hi> has become a current topic even on the crowded

            <head type="sub">By Arthur Schnitzler</head>
            <p>
               <ref type="question" target="#q088"/>I am inclined to say that there is no basic
               individual Jewish characteristic apart from certain traits acquired through force of
               environment. I do not believe that the Jew is essentially different from his Gentile
               fellow being; there is no difference of spiritual rhythm between them. The attitude
               of the world towards him has produced certain psychological modifications. Remove
               this attitude and those modifications will vanish.</p>
            <p>I believe that if a child of Jewish parentage, even of the humblest sort, were to be
               taken to another country, kept in ignorance of its origin, and if that origin were
               also kept from its associates, this child would grow up absolutely unconscious of a
               difference between its playmates and itself – save perhaps that it might develop and
               become aware of a keener and quicker brain.</p>
            <p>I have no hesitancy in affirming that the Jews are a creative people. We may be on
               the verge of a great artistic Jewish renaissance. Just what is the nature of the
               artistic message Judaism has to convey to the world, I am unable to say. Time alone
               will tell.</p>
            <p>As for the so-called Jewish problem, there is no <anchor type="commentary"

               </note> for it. <ref target="#q167" type="question"/>Zionism does not seem to me to
               be a solution at all. It seems to me actuated too much by sudden impulses, by
               resentment, by a mere desire to escape from one’s environment and scarcely ever to
               spring from a wellreasoned decision. Though I admire people who dream so splendidly,
               they cannot ever convince me. The Zionist plays actively into the hand of the
               anti-Semite; he confesses a weakness in our position which, to my mind, does not
               exist.</p>
            <p>I regard <ref target="#q167" type="question"/>Zionism as the worst affliction that
               had ever burst upon the Jews<c rendition="#dots" n="3"/> I do not mind recognizing
               Zionism as a moral principle and a social movement, if it could honestly be regarded
               in that light, but the idea of the foundation of a Jewish State on a religious and
               national basis strikes me as a nonsensical defiance of the whole spirit of historical
               evolution.</p>
            <p>My parents, for instance, came from <rs type="place" ref="#35512">Hungary</rs>, but I
               have no desire to return either to <rs type="place" ref="#35512">Hungary</rs> or to
                  <rs type="place" ref="#815">Palestine</rs>. I am rooted here in <rs type="place"
                  ref="#50">Vienna</rs>, I am an integral part of its highly individual culture; it
               in turn is a part of me. What care I about the opinion of a few ill-bred fools toying
               with anti-Semitism.</p>
            <p>However, I’ll admit that in spite of my complete indifference to every single form of
               religion, I would positively never allow myself to be baptized, even if it were
               possible – though that is less the case today than ever it was – to escape once and
               for all anti-Semitic bigotry and villainy by a dodge like that.</p>

            <p>No one can precisely determine what he owes to his ancestry and what to his
               associations.</p>
            <p>I am an <rs type="place" ref="#175">American</rs> of Jewish descent; my friend and
               neighbor is an <rs type="place" ref="#175">American</rs> of old <rs type="place"
                  ref="#254">English</rs> descent.</p>
            <p>We are both quietly proud of our differing inheritance, each recognizing the other’s
               pride as just and honorable. We have, I think, both self-respect and respect and
               liking for each other, and as Americans we cherish the same ideals and aspirations.
               My Judaism is summed in that often quoted pronouncement of the prophet Micah: »And
               what doth the Lord require of thee but to do justice and to love mercy and to walk
               humbly with thy God.« And my friend and I will have no material differences on points
               of religion or ethics.</p>
            <p>What is the inheritance of the Jew? It is an inheritance, physical, mental and moral,
               from a long line of intellectual, clean-living ancestors; it is the inheritance of
               the oldest civilization that has never been decadent, enriched by what the race has
               selected and absorbed from the many nations with which it has sojourned in its long
               pilgrimage; it is an inheritance of an alert, keen, logical, inquiring mind; tenacity
               of purpose, vivid perceptions, quick emotions, adaptability and faculty of
               assimilation; it is an inheritance of an insistent urge toward truth, an inexorable
               compulsion to ask in all exigencies, »Is this right or wrong«; it is an inheritance
               of the deepest feeling and the warmest sympathies. The Jew is the elder brother of
               humanity, and upon him lies the elder brother’s obligation of tolerance, forbearance,
               understanding, and appreciation of the rights and merits of others.</p>
            <p>I know that there is a little of this in me and necessarily in what I have done, but
               how much, of course, I cannot estimate; nor can I separate it from other innate
               elements; for I have two great grandfathers buried in the <rs type="place"
                  ref="#56505">valley of the Ohio</rs> in the soil they tilled, and I feel my roots
               very deep in the earth of this country that I love.</p>
            <p>I have never found that my being a Jew was an obstacle on any path that was worth the
               traveling. I have all the rights, all the equality that the law can give, and I ask
               no more. Were I to find that I was not wanted somewhere, I have too much self-respect
               to go where I am not desired. There is plenty of room. If anyone does not wish to
               associate with me, I recognize his right to his exclusiveness, even though I may
               think it absurd, and I certainly do not want to associate with him.</p>
            <p>If you ask me whether I feel that I owe more to Jews or non-Jews, I have so many
               loyal friends among both that it would be ungrateful in me even to try to compare
               benefits. While I have very little executive ability and have never sought nor
               desired leadership, I am repeatedly elected to important offices in organizations in
               which Jews are decidedly in the minority.</p>

            <p>I know that there is petty, anti-Jewish prejudice, but in this imperfect world there
               are far more violent prejudices against other groups, sects, races, and more or less
               arbitrary classifications of human beings; and it not infrequently happens that the
               cry of »race-prejudice« is raised by those who have incurred dislike through their
               own faults as individuals.</p>
            <p>Everyone has advantages and disadvantages, material, social and mental. Generally
               speaking, I believe that in a land of free opportunity the Jew, because of his
               inheritance, starts with a decided advantage. I wish that Jews would not whine over
               trivial or imaginary slights. I wish that more of them would be genuinely proud of
               their splendid inheritance and would hold their heads high, never in arrogance, but
               always in the self-respect that commands respect in others.</p>
